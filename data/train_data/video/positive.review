The Adventures of Christopher and Tricky
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
As popular as Prince was in the 80's, it's hard to believe it has taken 18 years for Under The Cherry Moon to find it's way to DVD.  Critics largely considered the film a stinker, especially considering it was only two years behind Purple Rain, but Under The Cherry Moon was a very good film, although very different than Purple Rain.  Shot in black and white, Under The Cherry Moon starred Prince as Christopher Tracey, him and his buddy Tricky (Jerome Benton from The Time) are living it up in Europe.  They wine and dine the rich and upper class and take their money, basically they are gigolos.  They swear it never gets personal until Mary Sharon comes into the picture.  Christopher falls for Mary in a big way, but her father Issac Sharon isn't having it.  Drama ensues. The soundtrack is awesome and includes the songs "U Need Another Lover Like You Need a Whole In Your Head," "Mountain," and "Kiss" and the DVD includes the videos for the songs shot for the film.  A must have for Prince fans.

This story is so fascinating that I couldn't stop feeling that the drive to create and to be true to one's identity and sexual preference had to be overwhelming to cause the writer, Arenas, to survive and escape the homophobic surroundings in Cuba under Castro.  Johnny Depp is unbelievably wonderful as both the sadistic lieutenant and the transporting Drag Queen

The Best Movie Set In the 50s Since Grease!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
"Cry Baby" is the coolest movie since Grease that deals with this time period. The songs are good and the actors in the film are really excellent. I'm a fan of Johnny Depp, and he came through in this movie and him in a lead role set in the 50s worked! This movie is not only a movie that takes place in the 50s, but it feels like a movie that was made in that decade as well. Everything that was big in the movies during that time are seen and used in here. I really enjoyed how this film also dealt with issues people had then and the way people acted and thought.

Waters Gets Wet With Cry Baby
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
John Waters who likes to be called the "Pope of Trash" has done a lot of films that are outrageous in style such as "Cecil B. Demented," "Pecker," & "Hairspray." "Cry Baby" is a 1990 musical that is utterly silly and frothy, but works nevertheless. Johnny Depp, now a big box office draw and critical success with Oscar nominations for "Finding Neverland" & "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," can be proud of the rockabilly Elvis-type singer he plays named Wade "Cry Baby" Walker. Depp performs his "Jailhouse Rock" type number with great energy and rebellion. Having him run through sewage pipes in his underwear is enough to set many a teenage girl's hearts aflutter. The female lead is Allison played by Amy Locane who worked in other films like "Airhead," "The Mummy" & "Bongwater." She does a good Olivia Newton John-like "Grease" character of the square girl who has a crush on Depp's bad boy. Stephen E. Miller who was recently seen in "RV" with Robin Williams and previously in "The Accused" with Jody Foster does a good job as the square boyfriend Baldwin who loses his girl to Cry Baby.

This movie shows the real life hell that was Andersonville.  A prison camp that turned into a death camp. Not enough food,water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there.

This is by far my favorite musical, not the concert but the actual musical from the 70's. When i saw Alexis Smith the first time i fell deeply in love. Of course i was only 24 at the time.Even though this is just the concert version minus the terrible cutting and editing it's better than nothing at all. This cast was also wonderful with it's vintage and well polished cast, I gave it the four stars only because it's not as complete as the CD. After all most of the people that would buy the concert version would also have been fans of the original show itself so why not include all the production numbers.Maybe if enough people make compaints do you think they may re-do this DVD?To all those wonderful women who were in the original production,,,Hats off, to those wonderful girls.. The likes of this will never come again

As a fan of New Order and Joy Division this was on the top of my list. Fast-paced, witty, and shot in documentary like style, 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE is a great movie along side the more traditional narratives like GO, ALL GONE PETE TONG, GROOVE, etc. Winderbottom does a terrific job in satisfying a range of audience and Steve Coogan is terrific. The soundtrack is solid and the produciton value is high. Not to be missed by fans (not ultimate fans) and general movie goers alike

What Legends Are Made Of
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Davy Crockett is one of Walt Disney's most endeared and remembered live action characters from the television and silver screen as personified by Fess Parker. This colorful and entertaining film was re-edited from three segments of Disney's TV show for theatrical distribution. Parker, with his coonskin cap and homespun drawl and witticism created a nationwide phenomenon in 1955. Who can forget "The Ballad Of Davy Crockett" composed by George Bruns and Tom Blackburn. Buddy Ebsen played his sidekick George Russel, whose adventures take them from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. to the Alamo. The film's third act focusing on the defense of the Alamo, though well remembered, is somewhat labored until we see the final image of Davy Crockett passing into legend and glory. This straightforward and beautifully photographed film expounds the virtues of honesty, integrity and bravery. Highly recommended family viewing personally produced by Walt Disney

This was not the scariest film I've ever seen, and I really can't take horror very well. But it was good, because there was beauty in it, and that is quite rare in horror films. I think the idea of the film was very good, and surprise in the end too, even though the plot was not so brilliant.

This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings.

It is easy to see why Jane Wyman, with her limpid eyes and winsome smile, won an Academy Award as a deaf-mute in this adaptation of the play "Johnny Belinda." The Academy is known for succumbing to characters with mental or physical afflictions ("The Snake Pit," "Rain Man," etc.) When she kneels beside the body of her father (Charles Bickford) and signs The Lord's Prayer, her Oscar was a secret even Price-Waterhouse couldn't keep. The temptation to cynicism, however, is unwise.

This film having been produced in 1957, was seen by me in 1958 while serving as a D.I. AT P.I. It showed for two consecutive nights and I think every D.I. on P.I. somehow arranged to see it. We wanted to see if they got it right I guess. I viewed it again recently and it was most nostalgic. A most memorable time and the film was reasonably accurate for the times. I highly recommend it

Thank God that there is a full recording of this evening available on CD, because this video only shows about 45 minutes of the actual concert. Granted, they are 45 minutes that are not to be missed with this brilliant cast and this amazing show from Stephen Sondheim. This is truly a Broadway event. The documentary, which makes up most of the running time of the video is a lot of fun, but cutting the actual concert down to bare bones is a sin. We who adored Sondheim should appeal to the producers and beg that this magical night be released on video in its entirety

This movie is a fast ride and a lot of fun.  It is the furthest thing from a slow-moving documentary.  The technical style and flair would appeal to practically any viewer.  The Source is glossy and gorgeous.  The director's clout is also impressive. Johnny Depp gives a performance monologue as Jack Kerouac and John Torturro gives an emotional reading from "Howl."  Dennis Hopper imitates Burroughs as well later in the film.  Their efforts are impressive.

This is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject.  The clips of Ginsberg &amp; Burroughs are especially effective.  The celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself &amp; not just empty theatrics. The Beats are still a source to return to for inspiration &amp; insight.  The world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now.  Of course there's more, but this video gives you enough to get you started &amp; gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late

Most Interesting Pre Code Examination Of Marital Infidelity With An Oscar Winning Norma Shearer
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
These early thirties films labelled as "Pre Code", are always most interesting to watch from a historical perspective as only a few years after this film was made such a topic would never have been able to be presented as it is here. The passage of time of course makes the subject matter of MGM's "The Divorcee", seem tame however back in 1930 this story was considered very adult and almost ahead of its time in its fairly honest examination of the "expected", roles for husbands and wives in the marital situation. Norma Shearer who today is sadly not well known really proved her acting chops in this vehicle and went home with the Best Actress Oscar that year for her troubles. Often labelled quite restrictively as the dignified first lady of MGM resulting from much of her later work in this decade in husband Irving Thalberg's prestige productions; here proves what she was capable of doing on screen when given meaty roles to tackle. Her other effort from this time "A Free Soul", makes a nice companion piece to "The Divorcee", in illustrating the range of roles Shearer was capable of handling when examining her overall career.

TBS Superstation.

I just watched the second half of Guarding Tess on TBS. It's now 11:30PM, and I am writing this review when I should be in bed 1 and half hour ago. Nicolas Cade and The old woman in the movie both turned in great performances. The story was lightly funny at first, but didn't really go anywhere. The relationship between The FBI agent and ex-first lady was strange, and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation, it was still weird. The climax came at the end, and was very entertaining, for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot. There is much meaning in the movie; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life. I was touched by the movie. Thank you. I should go to bed now

This is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie. It conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere. Once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of TOMANDANDY helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since DON'T LOOK NOW back in '73. This was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out, alongside WHITE NOISE, as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of The success of THE SIXTH SENSE.

Robin Williams is an AFRS disc jockey in Saigon during the Vietnam War. He is fast-talking, zany, unconventional - and a problem for his superiors. Williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone, doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can, that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten. The movie is an exhausting experience to watch, as it must have been for Williams to perform. It's an amazing one-man show, but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty

as an asian american, i just want to say how well this movie is made.  i'm not offended that this movie casted caucasian actors (come on people, this was in the 1930s!!)  and yes, there are a few scenes that are not in the book.  but, let's count how many hollywood movies (taken from books) that can't hold a candle to it's original masterpiece.  i love the movie 'misery' but if you've read the book, the book outshines the movie by a landslide.  so yes, the good earth movie has scenes that are different than the original book, but still a very well made movie nonetheless, particularly for the 1930s.  i saw it on tcm and am looking forward to getting the dvd

This is a good old fashioned film similar to the English film 'Goodbye Mr Chips'.  It has lots of old fashioned values and contains humour, pathos, passion and sentimentality which will tug at the heart strings!!!  I defy anyone not to have a lump in the throat or a tear in the eye when the long awaited Marr baby dies shortly after birth, or when James 'Red' Sandstrom Jr. comes to vist Marty at Christmas with his mother.  I just love the whole tone of the film - the director has got the atmosphere just right.  A real cracker of a film lacking in any real violence or nastiness I am pleased to say.  It is a film I can watch again and again.  Even my husband, normally quite reticent with such films, was impressed.  That to me was praise indeed

Let me start out this review by saying that this anime should be a martar for other anime to follow because it is an amazing anime. The plot is basically a cybernetic government agent, Major Motoko Kusanagi, who goes and tries to catch a computer virus called "The Puppet Master". From start to finish this movie is amazing with great animation and storyline. I think almost everybody should be able to see it as long as they are mature enough. There is a lot of violence and some language. Also, some slight nudity, but very non-sexual. Overall, I think this is one of the best anime ever

I can remeber being a little over eight years old the first time I saw this movie. While I didn't understand it then, I found that the music and the scenery was breath taking. Seeing this movie years later along with other great's such as Young Bess and Mary Queen of Scots, Helena Carter's and Cary Elwes performance's are right up there with such great names as Stuart Granger and Jean Simmons. I would recommend this movie if you like period piece movies, but like I said, don't take into account that the history is a little jumbled, just enjoy it for the tragic history that is burried underneath the plot.

An Outstanding Movie
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This 1993 movie, based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels, is over four hours long, but it uses that time well to document this critical Civil War battle.  I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary.  It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park.  When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened.

One of the most incredible and disturbing films ever made
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This film motivated me to do my own research and I read as much material on the case as I could possibly find--especially arguments from those who maintained that the three teenagers are guilty.  To be honest, I had a natural skepticism about the West Memphis Three's claims of innocence.  A coworker of mine was brutally murdered some years ago and two of her "friends" who were also coworkers were arrested for the murder.  I refused to believe it at first.  But it became clear over time that the evidence was overwhelming and conclusive.  Still there were those who refused to believe the facts and zealously argued their friends' innocence.  When all is done and said - it does come down to facts and whether or not one chooses to face reality and believe facts.

This outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things; like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink, decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis. Please notice how Lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama.

A masterpiece with Denzel at his best!

</title>
<text>
<Text>
This movie is based on reality in which the boxer Ruben Carter was wrongfully accused of murder. It shows how awful racism was and that makes one feel horrible. Just because Carter was black, he was imprisoned. This film is remarquable and Denzel Washington is absolutely fantastic as Ruben Carter. It shows his wrong accusation, the racism, and his descent into madness in prison. It's very sad but the ending ends out being a happy ending. Ruben Carter is helped by a group of Canadians who are inspired by his book that he had written and they try to help him get released from prison. It's a beautiful story and deserves to be watched by everyone. This movie is up there for me with films like the Shawnshank Redemption and the Green Mile! Highly reccomended

I recommend this movie as a most usually high star. The Torch Song Trilogy has done something that no other movie producer has dared to do (I will leave it to you to identify what that is). The torch song trilogy has blended wisdom and humor in a comical theatrical version of the life of drag queen, who is more than what she appears to be on stage. It identifies with what most homosexuals yearn for and the strength it takes to get it. This movie is inspirational, comical, sad, and dramatic. There is no other movie of its kind, and no other movie compares. The movie identifies that love can overcome all- and that if there is one thing homosexuals want, it is acceptance, and if you can not do that then get out. This is a must have. The ONLY five star movie I have ever watched

A Christmas Classic

<Text>
For every season, there is a classic movie.  In our house, "A Christmas Story" tops the list when Christmas rolls around.  Without a doubt this movie is a classic!  Ralphie and his quest for the Red Ryder BB gun -- I do love this movie.

James Mangold Identity is one hell of a movie. The twist is amazing, didn't see that coming. The ending will shock you to pieces. John Cusack and Amanda Peet are superb in their roles, he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to Flordia. Clea Duvall also appears in this film, Duvall was previously in Girl, Interrupted (another Mangold film). This film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes. Great direction, top-notch acting, and awesome plot. Identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time, I highly recommend this engrossing little film

What a great movie.  And it's still believable after all these years even with the mainframe computer consoles and tape reels and camera monitors.  The panscan is very well executed and hardly noticeable or annoying.  The print that was used has stood up very well.

Anne of Green Gables--Everyone's "Kindred Spirit"
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
"Anne of Green Gables--the Sequel"  Is  a well done, beautifully photographed and scripted portrayal of the wonderful novel by Lucy Maud Montgomery.  This movie continues the story of the older Anne Shirley as she faces the challenges of separating from the home she loves and staying true to her strong sense of self as she  finds her place in her adult world.  The interplay of familiar and newly introduced characters is compelling.  This movie is well worth your time and money and a great conversation starter for family time together.  Get the movie "Anne of Green Gables" also and watch it first for the most enjoyment.

Into The Blue turned out to be a decent movie. I was not expecting a story or ANYTHING from this movie other than pure eye candy. I was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography. The underwater shots are really breathtaking. I also enjoyed the special features on the DVD which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested.

Get Real - The best movie you will ever watch.

</title>

<Text>
Overwhelming in sincerity and pain. To watch and observe Stephan's life go from a pain of loneliness and secrecy to love and shame rips at your inside and leaves you feeling both uplifted and vulnerable at the same time. This cinematic masterpiece moves beyond the typical coming out story and focuses on true love and the boundaries it faces and must conquer inflicted not from the outside world but from the lovers themselves. Combining a mix of heart wrenching drama and laugh out loud dark humour I was left enthralled and fixated not wanting for it to finish. A great cast and a great script push this movie forward to the top of my list.

Knowing that "Stray Dog" was a movie by Akira Kurosawa gave me high expections and I was not disappointed.  The movie starts out as a sort of beaurocratic comedy as a plain clothes officer named Murakami has his pistol stolen by a pick pocket.  Despite the embarassment, it was a matter that could affect his continued employment with the force.  As he starts to track down which pickpocket might have done the job, it becomes apparent that the gun has been used in a violent crime.  At this point, the officer gets teamed up with an old pro named Sato and the two are on the hunt for a serious criminal.

The story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues. The real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives. I had to watch the movie's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished. I wonder what lawyers, FBI agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie.

1st of all if you are a Prince fan, then it is ofcourse the norm, that you have some favortism directed to the film. That would be me included!!! Does he ever not look good on camera??? I love his hair styles throughout the movie. O.K. now on the movie itself; I find the plot of it beautiful. I wish it did; however, show more erotic love scenes. I love the idea of this movie pertaining to the fact to w/ being a male gigolo, and finding love. THIS IS A PRINCE FILM that does not come on to often...this is simply beautiful B&W so clean looking. (...)! to all the naysayers, because Graffiti Bridge is sexy too! This could be a silent film, and I would still get it just to watch him sashay his cute (...)on screen...everything about him is art. More than half of all people even if they tried could not be such as he: An animated piece of expensive art on screen that you want to just watch...cut it out you haters he is GORGEOUS!!

There are few great movies that will make shed a tear, but this one is really great. Daughters don't know how much their mothers will go for them. They just understand their mothers when they get to be one. This movie, the place, the weather, the circumstances, is so depressive but beautiful. Dolores started to work hard out of love for her child, after that she worked because of gratitude. What a great woman and her daughter never understood her until the very end.

This movie is great. I remember watching it when I was really young. Im 21 now and still love it. Yeah some things are corny but that is part of what makes it great. Its not suppose to be realistic. Its fiction! I just realized too that the daughter is the girl from American Pie which makes it even funnier. Overall this movie is pretty good. If you dont care for the story, atleast get it to see Kim and the other chicks in the movie. If you've never seen the movie, just buy it. Its about the same as renting it a couple times and you will be able to keep it. For all you people who rated it a 1 you have issues!

Oh God, as a graduate of UAG I should say that this movies is nothing like the movie but I can't lie. The Madera's own the med. school.. the Leano's own the med. school. The Dean does not care about students.... Dean Villalobos and Martinez Sandoval dont care about the students. The infrastructure is a bit outdated.... you guessed it!! UAG's buildings are as old as Fenway without any upgrades.  Oh yeah, the pride and joy of the institution is the infamous PMC program:  "Programa Medicina en Comunidad", just like in the film!!!!   It is a riot! If you plan to go to UAG you must watch this film. If you get a hold of it, bring it down to Guadalajara so you can laugh.

Thoughtful 70's Sci Fi
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Logan's Run belongs to a class of old school science fiction films which were popular in the early and mid-1970's, prior to the beginning of the Star Wars franchise. These films did not rely on non-stop action or dazzling special effects, but rather on thoughtful, intelligent stories, intriguing "What if?" scenarios, and astute social commentary. They included Sci Fi classics such as Soylent Green, The Omega Man, The Andromeda Strain, Westworld, and others. While the shopping mall setting and some of the special effects of Logan's Run are pretty cheesy, it is still an interesting film and its themes may be even more relevant in today's botox era than they were in the 70's. I have heard they are doing a remake and would like to think it will improve on the original. Unfortunately, given the recent history of Hollywood, it is more likely that they will drain every last bit of intelligence out of the story, and replace it with more explosions, and perhaps Will Smith.

This is another american remake of the original Danish movie, starring Stellan Skarsgard, which is more interesting than this remake. I always wonder why, when Hollywood does a remake, they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place. Even though I give this remake 4 stars, mainly because Al Pacino and Robin Williams restrained themselves, and that Hollywood changed the ending. Check out the original. I give the Danish original 5 stars.

A Compelling Movie of Chesslike Stratagems
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Hucksters does an excellent job of portraying the cut throat business that advertising is.  Clark Gable, playing the suave but ethical advertising man, is the protagonist and he is pitted against the larger than life business tycoon Sydney Greenstreet.  Both are pitted against one another in this real life chess match, each making strategic moves of cunning, self-pride and power--Gable, in an attempt at making the advertising business a respectable one and Greenstreet by instilling fear into the bumbling idiots who surround him.  Greenstreet operates as though his customers are mindless sheep easily persuaded by fancy packaging and jingles of no substance whereas Gable is convinced that the customer is intelligent and is looking for more than bells and whistles when purchasing a product.

This wonderful little book is for you, the student of screenwriting.  How do I know?  I had the good fortune of being in Dr. Claudia Hunter Johnson's screenwriting class at Florida State University.  We used the methods described in her book and they work!  If you are disciplined enough to follow her process, you will amaze yourself.  You will begin with Le Menu (your very own personal autobiography) and finish with a well-crafted script.  Although you will not have her direct feedback, you will have the benefit of a script coach who has helped launch a thousand careers.  Tom

Labyrinth - fantasy and fun
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Labyrinth is a delightful movie of fantasy and fun for all ages to enjoy.  This has always been one of my favorite films, and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more.  Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance as Sarah, the main character, whose baby brother is taken by the Goblin King (David Bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time; he wrote and performed all the music, which is also some of his best work).  Sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive Labyrinth to save her brother in time before he's turned into a goblin.  Along the way, we encounter a large cast of Jim Henson's puppet-creatures, some of which become Sarah's friends and helpers in her journey.  The puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people.  The movie is filled with magic, both on and off screen.

How can we ever be disappointed by a Anthony Hopkins performance? In my opinion, one of the best actors of all time ( especially his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter ). In this movie, he plays a anthropologist first living in Africa among the rare and beautiful mountain gorillas. After defending the gorillas and killing 2 poachers in the process, he is captured and sent to a mental institution where a psychologist played by Cuba Gooding Jr.( who gives a good performance) tries to delve in the mind of Hopkins' character and help him. I just love the flashbacks to Africa and the gorillas. Very touching scenes in this movie along with great acting. My favorite part of the movie is the ending where we see Hopkins return to the gorillas and the place he feels he truly belongs and truly wants to be. Great movie!

A DEMENTEDLY TWISTED AND GREAT SATIRE
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Most people I know who have viewed this film fall into two categories. On one side there are those who hate it, while on the other are those who like it. I am of the latter group. This is not a comedy, although one gets the feeling that with so many absurdities in the lives of the characters that make us laugh, it appears to be a comedy. However, make no mistake about it, this brilliant film is more than that. It is a biting satire of a very dark side of life. One I wouldn't wish on anyone.

"Cube" has a classicly well put together screenplay held back by poor acting
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
After reading the very positive reveiws of this late 90's thriller I decided that it deserved at least a rental. I must confess that I am glad that I happened to stumble upon this movie on Amazon because it was everything that a horror movie should be. The Screenplay was very put together, the plot & setting were intriguing yet mysterious & the killings (Or cinematography if you want to make it sound all fancy) & visuals are quite impressive for it's 500,000$ dollar budget. Now, the only real complaint that I can say about the film is that the acting is horrid. Now dont get me wrong not ALL of the acting was that bad but I would be lying if I said that most of the actors were okay, the truth is that most of them had very little experience and THAT made the film look all-around quite a bit less professional and hard to look at as an ELITE horror film. I think that if the producers would have known when they made the film that it would do so well and have such great reveiws and number of veiwers than they would have been more than willing to dish out the few extra bucks in order to have some more experienced actors.

Putting it simply, this film is the work of a genius. As a Tom Stoppard fanatic, I adored it from the moment I read the play, which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with. He was significantly more satisfied with the movie, and there is very little doubt as to why. He clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working.

a beautiful and funny English classic
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Although it is very funny, and it is about talking animals that drive cars, "The Wind in the Willows" is not suitable for four to eight year olds to read on their own.  That would be the Disney cartoon version, not the book, which is pretty sophisticated for such a young age group.  It is great to read aloud, however, and for older kids who love nature and humor, "The Wind in the Willows" could lead to a lifetime love of books.  "The Wind in the Willows" reminds me of the Victorian humor book "Three Men in a Boat", because both are about the adventures of a group of wacky English bachelors messing about in boats on the river.  It is funny, with real slapstick comedy, and it is also touching, because it deals with friendship and loyalty, and beautiful, because it is about nature, and love of the countryside and home.

The Mothman Prophecies - a different take
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I just read Dirk's "spolier" ending to the Mothman Prophecies and had to say huh?  Demonic, fallen angles? What?  Did we watch the same movie?  If all you go by is the movie, that might be the impression you're left with. But if you've ever looked into the events that happened around Point Pleasant, or any of the books on the subject, you'll see that the Mothman was more UFO related than anything. At same time of the Mothman sightings the Point Pleasant area  was in a wave of UFO reports, Men-In-Black, and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky. In fact, Mothman played only a very small part in the drama, it was by far predominately UFO related, as Keel makes clear.

This movie is wonderful. Although it didn't exactly make me cry, it did touch me in a sentimental way. I fell in love with Morrie. He is such a sweet guy, and his story is an inspiration to everyone. I was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life, even though fate had handed him a death sentence. He made up his mind that he wasn't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself; he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible, and I really admire that.

Given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it's sort of surprising that it hasn't received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process.  Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.

I have loved this movie ever since I saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on (it's been some time now) and I plan to buy it.  Waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father.  I didn't realize when I first saw it that Reese Witherspoon was the daughter (that was before Reese Witherspoon became Reese Witherspoon).  A heartbreaking, beautifully acted and must-see film.  Rings true to life.  They certainly don't make movies like this anymore, and it's a shame

His words to the jury, a petition for strength for them against great odds, for himself against greater odds, for a system sometimes blind to justice, and for the victim of negligence who has no voice, puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of 'The Verdict.'

THIS 1948 15-CHAPTER SERIAL FEATURES SUPERMAN [PLAYED HERE BY THE LATE KIRK ALYN] GOING UP AGAINST A GANG OF CROOKS. THIS IS A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN THE 1950S TV SHOW THAT FEATURED GEORGE REEVES! AT LEAST THIS SERIAL WAS FUN TO WATCH AND AT LEAST YOU CAN GET INTO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THIS SERIAL IN STORES TODAY, BUT, IF, BY SOME CHANCE, YOU COME ACROSS THIS VIDEO, GET IT!!!!

An old movie, but a good movie.  The end is a sad comment on the society of tomorrow.  Heston and Robertson do a great job of acting.

Small-Scale Indie Has Its Charms and Nicely Etched Performances

</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am hopeful that Katie Holmes has not forsaken a promising acting career to become tabloid fodder and a Stepford wife for her couch-jumping husband-to-be. It's not that she strikes me as all that brilliant, but she does bring a relatable sense of humanity to her role as April Burns, a rebellious twenty-something girl who has defiantly moved away from her family's upstate home to a tenement in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Encouraged by her new boyfriend Bobby (who happens to be black), she invites her estranged family to Thanksgiving dinner where she will cook the whole meal in her tiny apartment. There is a tragic undertone to the event since her angst-driven mother is dying of breast cancer, and this may be their last meal together

A curious but engaging alternative Thanksgiving movie
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Katie Holmes plays April, a young woman whose family has despaired of her.  She has invited them for Thanksgiving dinner, and it's particularly important because her mother (Patricia Clarkson) has cancer and is not expected to live. Katie is living in NYC with her boyfriend in the kind of grafitti-covered apartment building filled with an odd assortment of tenants that is only to be found in NY -- in other words, it will terrify her non-urban family.  The film begins as Katie wakes up -- she's never cooked a big dinner like this before and has a reputation for failure with her family.  In fact, her family puts her down so much that you quickly feel sorry for her -- no-one could be that bad, and isn't your family supposed to have an unnaturally high opinion of you, and not the other way around?

Underrated romantic comedy
</Text>

<Text>
Prince's 1986 romantic comedy "Under the Cherry Moon" finally received the DVD treatment it deserved in the Summer of 2004. When the film was released, it was bombarded with bad reviews but this film is actually decent. Of course the music stands out but it actually succeeds as a comedy. The acting may be full of flaws but it's the 80's, what do you expect? Prince and Jerome Benton , from The Time, are gigolos living it up in South France and they come across a beautiful heiress (Kristin Scott Thomas) who happens to get her trust fund on her 21st birthday. They both woo her for the money but Prince ends up catching feelings for her. With a beautifully filmed movie and an incredible soundtrack, "Under the Cherry Moon" fails to disappoint

I love this movie!! I remember the first time I saw it, I was about 6-7 yrs.old, on a plane & on my way to Puerto Rico.  Eighteen (or so) years later, I bought it & watched it with my family, it brought back so many great memories, We loved it all over again. I love the music, the dancing & the actors/actresses, The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because IT IS AN 80's MOVIE!  We all know how 80's dance movies  have the bad fame of neing CORNY!  I have to admit, it did have some corny and bad acting moments, but all in all, I think this is an amewome movie, I love it & recommend it

I went out and rented it right away, and I have watched it about 100 times since then.  I tried to get a copy for years without realizing I could just order it on Amazon.  It's such a sweet touching story.  It's a bit off the wall, but that's of course what I love about it

DVD newcomer "Fort Apache" (1948) looks great, with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images (from original nitrate elements) and bugle-brisk audio. The film, ironically, finds Henry Fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against John Wayne's humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice.

She says, " The last thing I want is to see you end up a drunk hanging out in front of one of these liquor stores or killed. Look at me, I'm serious. I love you. You're my only son." She just can't take his problems anymore.

THis is one of my favorite movies. Besides containing a stellar cast (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Sammuel L.

It's suspenseful, deep, VERY emotional.. slightly dark.. it's the perfect movie. Even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you.

This is, by far, the best "beginners" video I have ever done. I am a HUGE fan of the FIRM workouts; their approach is based on science, they have a diverse selection (I own over 30 FIRM videos and DVDs), their instructors know what they're doing, and most of all, THEY WORK. These workouts, combined with the sensible FIRM eating plan (it is NOT a diet, but a practical plan based on the food pyramid) helped me quit smoking without gaining a pound...in fact, I lost weight and was in the best shape of my life. Now that I'm planning to quit again, these videos are the first things I'm pulling out of my "toolbox." Tracy Long is one of the best instructors the FIRM had; she gives excellent demonstration and information regarding form and "how to's," and I find her quiet style preferable to hyper cheerleader types. She remains a great inspiration for me

The traveling plot seemed like a take-off of 'Trains, Planes, and Automobiles' - traveling from NY to Savannah vs traveling from Chicago to NY. Same sequence: airplane delays, then train occurrence, then bus, then jalopy-type car. But, since I totally enjoyed the Steve Martin movie, I also enjoyed 'Forces of Nature'. The writer even threw in some weather and fire, same as 'Trains, Planes, and Automobiles'. Because of the similarities, I rated it four stars instead of five.

I remember watching Anne of Green Gables when I was a little girl with my sister, over and over again. Laughing everytime Anne broke her slate on Gilberts head, or when she accidently dyed her hair green, or when she waxes poetic about her "bosom friend". It made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old. I would recommend this movie for anyone young or old. It is a beautiful heartwarming movie, with gorgeous scenery, unforgettable characters, and plenty of moments to laugh and cry

15 Minutes is worth the money.  It probably will not be the number one DVD in your collection, but you're sure to go back and watch it from time to time.  This film gives an interesting, if not frightening, look at the role mass-media play in our country's daily life.  We don't think about it, since we are living it... but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced, 24-hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today.

First heard his stand-up on CD when I worked at Borders a few years back.

Clean (no naughty words or uncouth situations here!), family-fun comedy (dirty or clean, as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well, then he/she is funny in my eyes)

Primative Slasher that Works! GIALLO (PG version is cut)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Hey if you have all seen the works of Argento and Fulci then you probably understand how illogical GIALLO is. This was not always the case and some of them come across as quite alright in the end. I would actually recommend this Argento 'primative slasher' over Fulci's "Don't Torture a Duckling" - not anywhere near as good as its GIALLO hype, this version of The Bird With the Crystal Plumage I watched was uncut and a lot more violent than the PG version that has less murder violence, but is still dark all the same. Although I give this five stars, it is more of a three star movie, but this is the one that started a whole cult wave of stuff like this, and for that it is recognized and prized, but you have seen better Argento and GIALLO, I recommend that you get SUSPERIA before this. I say stay away from "Don't Torture a Duckling"

Great acting by Anthony Hopkins
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Anthony Hopkins is absolutely riveting as Adolf Hitler.  He captures all of Hitler's mannerisms, quirks, and facial expressions.  My only complaint is that he doesn't use a German accent.  The production is poor, and there are some flaws in the story.  For example, Albert Speer is made out to be almost a hero in the film.  It has been proven that there was actually no assassination attempt made by Speer.  The guy who plays Joseph Goebbels is horrible, one of the worst acting jobs I've seen.  But overall the acting is great, and the performance by Hopkins makes this movie worth owning

This a wonderful movie. I had never seen it before. I am 65 and was a teenager in the fifties and an avid movie goer. Some of these old black and white films bring back memories of a time when life seemed to begin every moment. It was a time after the war and people were just beginning to discover each other. The old Italian movies had a grittiness to them. A reality from far away places where life just had a different style. La Strada and the Nights of Cabiria were from this time. I feel such a pull watching them, wishing things had never become so modern. The Bicycle Thieves belongs in this catagory. The reproduction is marvelous. Clean and smooth. I am glad that this movie has been restored. Its a beautiful piece of the past.

This is the original version of this film with David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and other very familiar faces.  The film is nothing at all like the 2006 version which was very good.

My 20-something grandson is a 007 fan and he really liked this movie; had to have the DVD after seeing it on TV

A Great Film
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
It all started with John Malkovich. Me seeing the movie I mean, not the film itself. I was scanning through Malkovich's filmography and saw this film in their. I had heard of the film, but had no idea what it was about but I checked it out. Malkovich is close to top billing, but his role is really small...Having said that, this was an amazing film. Truly a work of art. The movie stars Sam Waterston ('Serial Mom') playing Sydney Schanberg, a New York Times columnist who heads to Cambodia on the brink of war. Bombs have been dropped, labor camps have been set up and Schanberg wants to write about all of it. When he gets there he meets Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor, who won an Oscar for the role), who becomes his friend and interpreter. Malkovich plays Schanberg's photographer Al Rockoff; His role is brief, but he leaves his mark. After Schanberg's war entraps himself and his fellow journalists, Pran saves him from being executed but is himself placed in a labor camp. The script is based on a New York Times article by Schanberg called The Death and Life of Dith Pran. When I saw that, I figured this would be a rather depressing story. Truth is, the film is quite uplifting. The choice to use John Lennon's "Imagine" for the final scene was perfect. Anyway, back to the synopsis...Schanberg is back in New York, while Pran slaves at the labor camp. Schanberg has no idea whether Pran is alive or dead, but doesn't give up on the idea of one day reuniting with his friend. Most films that take place in this setting, I'm not a big fan of. I'm not saying I didn't like these films, but movies like The Constant Gardener and Beyond Borders are a bit like this movie. Although, for the record, this film is way better. Having said those last two things I was surprised that I liked this film. Whether you're a fan of these kinds of movies or not, you need to see this. It's an important and uplifting movie, that no one should not see.

I finally made my first purchase from Amazon's Unbox Video Downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience. For $1.99, I purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of "The Twilight Zone", and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection. I don't think it's the most ideal way to see full-length motion pictures, but for a 26-minute classic TV program, I think my 17" LCD monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience, and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean.

Very well made, well acted, important message.

<Text>
This film is really excellent, with a great cast, and a thoughtful and frightening message. We see the story of a group of high school boys graduating and then immediately joining the German army to fight in World War I.  The story revolves around Paul Baumer, a thoughtful and sensitive young man who gradually sees so many horrors of war, and loses so many of his friends, that he is transformed into a different person, a war-weary pessimist with no illusions, no dreams, no purpose, and no homeland.  Richard Thomas does a masterful job of playing Paul Baumer. He is supported with a fantanstic cast of actors.  Ernest Borgnine plays the peasant shoe maker who leads their platoon. He is an earthy fatherly survival focused man who does his best to ensure his men have food, rest, shelter, and take no outrageous risks of glory. Paul learns much from this man, who becomes a surrogate father and mentor. Ian Holm plays a military school drill instructor who is a sadist. Eventually his sadism goes too far and he is sent to the front lines where he exhibits cowardly actions that ironically result in his receiving a medal from the Kaiser. Patricia Neal plays Paul's dying mother. Paul has seen so much death that he is only able to show dispassionate empathy with his mother and tells her lies about the front lines so that she does not die of cancer worrying about her son. Donald Pleasance plays a high school instructor who fills the heads of young men on concepts of national glory, heroism, manhood, and other nonsense to which 18 year old boys fall victim.

NUTS is a great movie from Barbra Streisand. One of her best acting performances! The movie is about a high class call girl named Claudia (Barbra Streisand) who kills a client in self defense. Her parents want to avoid scandal by having her declared mentally incompetant to stand trial. After attacking her attorney, her case is taken over by a legal aide attorney (Richard Dreyfuss). Claudia doesn't do much to help her case, with her constant outbursts in the courtroom. It was a really well done drama, with an interesting plot and good acting all around

Arthur 10th anniversary show

<text>
<Text>
This two parter commemorates the  10th anniversary of the Arthur show on PBS. It's nice, they could have gone cheesy and just recycled old footage but they decied to be subtle about it. Really the only thing that specifically makes this a 10th anniversary show is the fact that there are '10's hidden throughout each episodes kind of like how Marc Brown hides the names of friends and family in his picture books. It's nice to see them both together too (episodes 1 & 2), I think they aired them seperately on TV

A Good Adaptation...A Hard "Movie" To Pull Off

Okay, for all those who are fans of the Orwell classic, you have to understand how difficult this tale is to bring to the big or small screen.  We're dealing with talking animals relating to humans.  This tale is too deep for the "movie public" and ANY movie will fall short for true purists.

I viewed this film a few years ago when I had nothing to do and found this to be a masterpiece.  Luis Bu 's direction is unique.  I found that the main character's desposition changes his love for the woman.  When she gets him angry, we see one woman.  When she makes him happy, we see a different woman in the same character.  I don't think I've seen a movie quite like this.  This movie will stay with you for some time, especially if you have a broken heart.

<Text>
Prepare yourself for an illuminating evening which begins in an upscale New York bar but slowly degenerates into visiting some of the more unseamly locations of the big city. The story revolves around Rodger (Campbell Scott), an egotistic, insecure, overly analytical wordsmith who has just been dumped by his female boss (Isabella Rossellini). His sixteen year old nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) unexpectedly shows up in his office and Roger decides to break the young boy in 'New York Style.' Prepare for a crash course in how to pick up a woman as taught in the sometimes alluring, often times sleazy world of Uncle Roger, the proverbial lounge lizzard.

"Shampoo" is probably the most sophisticated sex comedy ever made in this country. It's a very clear-eyed (and very funny) look at how love and lust get inextricably mixed up with up with power, money, position, and politics. Of course, contrary to almost every critique posted here, George (Warren Beatty), the philandering Beverly Hills hairdresser, is the primary victim of the rules of the game, late-60s Southern California-style. Unlike the protagonist of the great Renoir movie, George doesn't end up dead, but he's left alone, abandoned by all the women he's bedded, looking like a naive fool. And that's George's sin--he's an uncynical romantic in a world that doesn't know the difference between felt emotion and deliberate calculation. He sleeps with women because he genuinely likes them. For him, taking a woman to bed is an extension of doing her hair--it's an intimate act in which he makes her look and feel better. All the other characters in the movie use sex as part of a larger plan--they each have some separate goal on their mind, which they achieve in one way or another, and George is left behind with his silly emotional and sexual vulnerabiliy. He's Don Giovanni in reverse--the boy who can't say no because he actually gives a damn--and he pays a steep price for his availability. Playing a slightly out of it dupe, Beatty has never been better or more dazzlingly glamorous. And he's surrounded by a flawless ensemble cast--Lee Grant is simply astonishing as a deceived and deceiving Beverly Hills matron, and Julie Christie, in her flared pants and mini skirts, is peerlessy sexy as the 1968 version of a Rodeo Drive courtesan. Thanks to Robert Towne,  "Shampoo" also has some of the most natural, unforced, yet revealing dialog ever heard in an American movie--nothing is stylized or italicized, but every nonchalant remark hits target like a polished Wilde epigram. Delectable

With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.

one of the greatest screwball comedies

easily one of the funniest movies ever made. its incredible today to realize that irene dunne never won an oscar, and this year is the most galling of all, as she lost to the ridiculous luise rainer in "the good earth"; and even more galling to realize that cary grant was not even nominated (after all, its only a comedy, right?) but this is a movie that will never age: it makes me laugh as much today as when i first saw it on television thirty years back, and if id been alive to see it in a theater 70 years ago, the response would be the same. dunne and grant excel as a divorcing couple who sabotage each others new relationships, and randolph scott is a miracle as dunnes new fiancee ("not oklahoma city ITSELF?!"). but it is irene dunne who is the star here, and until such time as "theodora goes wild" and "show boat" are finally released on dvd, this is the best of her 30s roles.

The Movie has always been a favorite of mine.  If you have a big screen TV, this movie on DVD will appear to be sloppy in some areas, but if you just follow the story and enoy the music, you'll over come the critical nit picking of your prefectionate self.  Go look in the mirror by the way.

This is my favorite film, bar none.  MPI Home Video is releasing this title on DVD 5/15/07, according to MPI's official site.  In addition, as of this writing (Feb 07), this stellar film is showing in theatrical re-release in as many as 30 American cities.  This film has everything an epic should have: a first-rate cast, beautifully-written screenplay, spectacular (and mostly historically accurate) settings, even solid humor.  I've been waiting for this to be released on DVD for years

I like almost everything that Andrew V. McLaglen directs. This film has quite a lot of good things to recommend it. Mostly I like the opening Civil War scene and later Wayne, Rock Hudson and company doing battle with the invading French down in Mexico. There's enough humor, action and emotion to go around not to mention Hugo Montenegro's very good score

I'm 7 months pregnant and have been looking for videos that I can do in short blocks of time, and this one is perfect.  I've been a fan of Tamilee's for quite a while and have several of her tapes, all of which are great.  She's very motivating and encouraging, and I like the fact that she really has a good background (education-wise) when it comes to fitness. This one is no exception.  Just a warning - if you are looking for complete body toning or cadrio, you won't find it here: this one just hits the main areas (legs, biceps, triceps, shoulders, butt and abs).  But that doesn't mean it's easy!  I found myself sweating just doing a few of the exercises (even before I became pregnant) and I'm in fairly good shape.  I'd recommend doing this video and interspersing it with other longer, total body sculpting videos

Meet Me in St. Louis takes a war-torn America back to a simpler time, a time when telephones were new and everyone was talking about the World's Fair. The Smith family is very close, and although each of them have their problems, they share their lives with each other. Esther (Judy Garland) has a crush on "The Boy Next Door," and sings a beautiful song about him. Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes to be proposed to, even if it is over the telephone. Tootie (Margaret O'Brien) has a fascination with death and a wants to be included with the older kids. Everyone's lives are changed, however, when they hear that their father is going to move everyone to New York for his job.

not the most realistic movie but still a  great one
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Yes, this movie is kind of unrealistic but so what. And just to re-clear up the bike thing. It wasn't a coaster brake bike like you had on your old banana seat bike when you were a kid. It's a track bike with a fixed gear. Which means the pedals spin as long as the rear wheel spins. And backward pressure slows your speed but does not completely stop it.That why he always jumped off the back and grabed the seat when he wanted to stop quickly. That is also why anyone crazy enough to ride a track bike on the street usually has a front brake installed. Look at the scenes where he is freestyling in his apartment. He is pedaling backward. This can only be done on a fixed gear. No coaster brake. If you look really closely at some of the scenes you will be able to see different bikes. Like when Bacon rides down the stairs, you can see the bike he's on has brakes. Obviously for the stunt. But I really like this movie. I've been a messenger and I always wanted the place I worked to be like that movie. We never went outside and freestyle in the street while the boom box played. And hot girls never gave me their phone number. But we get to see Lawrence Fishburne as Voodoo when was still know as Larry. And that's worth the 13 bucks right there

Singer had the best male body, bar none, I have ever seen in films and *it* is really the star of this one, right behind the two ferrets, "Beastmaster's" friends. Most of the camera angles enhance Singer's musculature. He has learned how to stand and move to best advantage for the cameras. He's not handsome, though, which doesn't really matter in this film.

One of the best soundtracks of 1998
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This album has pure energy, pure lyrics, pure beats. Everything went right in this soundtrack. Public Enemy seldomly puts out any bad albums. The title song in this album &quot;He Got Game&quot; was a pretty weak song.  The beats were nice though, but this song leans a little towards the blues  and jazz catogorie. That was the only song that I disliked out of 12  tracks. The album starts off with the song Ressurection, that track was so  beautifully produced it sounded way beyond Public Enemy's music. Masta  Killa dropped a verse that was so so tight. Track 3 wit KRS-ONE was one of  the best, number 5 had a cool beat. The rest of the tracks were just Public  Enemy style. This is a great album for a Public Enemy fan

Lawrence Tierney Rules!!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Yes, this film feels like a diatribe.  It's probably less factual than the film version of John Dillinger's exploits that director John Milius made in the seventies.  So why do I recommend this film over Milius' more polished account?  Well, this film in a campy, over-the-top way is just so entertaining.  Secondly, Lawrence Tierney in the title role is such a magnetic screen presence.  His tough ferocity keeps the film's campier elements in check and grounds it in some semblance of reality.  There's also a good supporting cast here with gangster veterans Marc Lawrence and Elisha Cook Jr. (seems like he's in all these noir-gangster flicks) on hand.  The story is told here crisply and in an economical 70 minutes so if you have an hour plus to kill there's worse ways to do it.  Oh, John, if only you had the two bucks to pay for the drinks!

Great end of the world flick
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
When Worlds Collide has all the ingredients of a great movie for the year that it was made.  The actors were great.  The story is scary when you start to think that this can happen.  The ending was excellent.  Not a happy ending for mother earth but not all end of the world movies should have the earth been saved.  I bought the movie and seeing it many time and still like it.

Jet Li  or Jackie Jan Fighting?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This Jet Li movie is thus far the best movie since Shaolin Temple as Younger Jet Li. Its awesome surreal fighting creates this Epic feel to the whole Genre of martial arts fighting. Jet Li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie. It has laughter, suspense, compassion, and innocense. The most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the Witches pawn. This film is highly recommended to those who love Jet Li and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. An Excellent movie to add to the Jet Li collection

Last Stand of Westerns
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
It is truly a pity that the western has died off. They are rare and far between these days. A few years back Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot made a few together and separate. They are all worth seeing. This one has Tom playing Cable, a confederate soldier who has left the war early because he knows it is over and the South has lost. It just hasn't been declared yet. His family and friends thought him to be dead, and the reunion seems a bit shaky. His wife played by Suzy Amis, is a tough as nails no nonsense frontier woman that knows guns well from her fathers gunsmithing business.

there was a tv series

<Text>
There used to be a tv show of the Baby-sitter's club and I loved it. It used to air on the Disney channel. When disney wasn't pathetic as a ballon back then. But the film was great... I remember the times when i used to read the books. Their classic books for kids. But the movie is awesome. The girls played to their characters wonderfully. In the movie Christy was my favorite, the girl who played her, anyway. I like the scene when Christy went to the fair and her dad didn't show up. To me that was mean. Then she was walking in the rain. The rest of BSC showed up. It all became a happy ending, which was good. I can't wait to get it on dvd.

My husband, ex-military and combat veteran , doesn't watch war movies, but a friend recommended this movie and, when it arrived, my "MAN" agreed to watch it with me.  Well, Honey, what do you think? HE SAID: "HOLLYWOOD TRULY IS A LAND OF IMAGINATION AND FANTASY." I SAID: "THAT WAS A GOOD WAR MOVIE."  HE SAID: "THAT WAS NOT A WAR MOVIE, IT WAS A MOVIE ABOUT PERSONALITIES: THERE WAS NO WAR IN THAT MOVIE."  Well, he's right, but, I LIKED THIS MOVIE, AND, I THINK, MOST OTHER PEOPLE WILL TO.

Americana on the Plains
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
High-energy encapsulation of the American spirit in this tough-tender production.  Done lean and hard-scrabble, as opposed to the lush and green Hollywood version.  Curley really is as wonderful as he sings he is. Aunt Eller, the matriarch, as done by Maureen Lipman is tough, and loving.  Jimmy Johnson, the Welshman, jigs and does rope-tricks.  Shuler Hensley's Jud is repulsive, and vulnerable.  A classic.  For your permanent library.

john carpenter's ghost of mars
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This a classic John Carpender film but defentaly one that needs a sequel by him. The skill with which action mixed with heavy metal music is excellent. As far as I'm concerned everyone in this si-fi horror thriller did their job right. I could feel it ,be it , live it. It could be real. Each character brought something essential to this film. I'm not the only one that likened the  martian leader to a cross between Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie. There are very powerful fight survival scenes with just enough blood and gore to freak you out and keep you on edge. Who will get possessed next? A must see. More than once to notice all of the effects, and believe me they are powerfull.

Chaplin works on &quot;The Kid,&quot; &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; &amp; &quot;City Lights&quot;
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
&quot;The Great Director,&quot; Volume 2 in the &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot; series from Thames Television, looks at Chaplin working on some of his biggest films, including &quot;The Kid,&quot; &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;City Lights.&quot;   The chief assets of this documentary are the treasures found in the Chaplin family private film vault, including discarded sequences and home movies never before seen by the public.  There are also interviews with Jackie Coogan, Lita Grey, Virginia Cherrill and others who worked with Chaplin.  The emphasis remains on how Chaplin worked, beginning with simple sight gags and slapstick and transforming them into comic masterpieces.  This volume also gets into a bit more of Chaplin's artistic temperament, especially when his patience ran thin with Cherrill and he temporarily replaced her with Grey as the blind girl in &quot;City Lights.&quot;  There are even clips of the film's classic ending shot with Grey.  Kevin Brownlow and David Gill were given access to these unseen films by Oona Chaplin and they make the most of it in providing a portrait of a great artist at work.  James Mason provides the narration, managing to sound like a college professor lecturing students and at the same time like a fan of Chaplin's comic genius.  Whether you have seen a few or all of Chaplin's films, &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot; is an absolute treat

As soon as I walked out of the theater I declared that I had to own a copy of this movie.  I had to wait a long time for it to be released to DVD (it was in theaters in late winter but they didn't put it to DVD till almost a year later...probably hoping to capitalize on awards' season reviews and recommendations).  It was well worth the wait.

Nature's Ways
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The movie "Days of Heaven," written by Terrence Malic, is a movie of transcendentalism, anti-transcendentalism, and nature. In class, we have been discussing the term transcendentalism. Also we have talked about how nature cannot be destroyed or stopped. Nature itself balances out life. From a meteor crashing to earth wiping out all life, to a simple hurricane wiping out a whole city and killing thousands, nature cannot be inverted and prevented. In the movie "Days of Heaven," this idea is clearly shown. The scene where the locusts were eating the crops is the prime example in this movie to me of how nature will always have its ways of evening things out. When life starts to get ahead, when things are going well for everyone, something always seems to happen. In this movie, everything was going well for everybody. This is when nature comes into play. Locusts come to eat all crops. This is nature acting in response to the success of humans. What this says is that no matter how powerful humans are, the machines we have, or the ideas we come up with, nothing stands up to nature.

Light, sparkling, set in Italy, but feels a bit staged
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There is no way around it, no matter how it is staged Shakespeare will inevitably feel like a stage play. That it is acted by two of Britains foremost stage actors of the time, Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson (who at this stage were still married) adds to the feeling. There is some over the top voice projection, but generally this feels light, fun and a pretty glorious rendition of one of Shakespeares frothiest plays.

TCM III was a good movie.It had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror movie.It lacked the essential characters,though.It would've done better if they had brought Chop Top or Drayton back to life.The film is about two friends headed down to Florida from Texas when they come upon a pit of decayed bodies.We already know it was Leatherface,and the two drive on.The next day,they come upon a gas station,where a crazy,yet funny gas station attendant named Alfredo work.Also making his appearance here as well is Viggo Mortenson as Tex,a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends guidance.The two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods,pursued by the evr vigialnt Leatherface armed with his trusty chainsaw.It gets the job done every time.As in the Texas Chainsaw tradition,they are captured and prepared for dinner.One of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on Leatherface with the help of an Veteran they met along the way.It's an overall good movie and I loved it

I very much enjoyed this story of a man battling drug addiction-alcoholism.Michael Keaton has never been better and his portrayal is dead-on, even when the film is occasionally hard-going at times.In fact, the whole cast is first-rate, the direction good, and the script unflinching and realistic. Of all the films about drug addiction, this one is highly recommended. and the ending is even happy

I remember the first time I saw the movie on TBS in the U.S. As usual, I started watching half-way into it and I was amazed by an unknown actor/star (Van Damme) who captivated my interest with some of the most awe-inspiring martial arts moves I'd have ever seen at the time. As a young teenager, this movie was very inspiring (to get involved in martial arts).

This film must be scrutinized in the light of being Tony Scott a famed and renowned director of spot lights and subtle commercials at that moment. Additionally the figure of the vampire is refreshed and renovated with the presence of the feminine vision. Sarandon and Deneuve are in very good shape and Bowie gives another of his outrageous and perverse performances; after his standout performance in "The man who fell to earth" and "Furyo."

Camp Classic!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Wow, this l932 camp classic squeezes so much into its running time--S&amp;M, near-nudity, drugs, racism,sex, sex--you're left gasping. Boris Karloff turns in a delightful turn as the menacing Fu Manchu. Myrna  Loy, in her pre-superstar days, is his &quot;horribly ugly&quot; daughter,  who delights in capturing gorgeous hunk, Charles Starrett, and playing with  him like a toy. His nearly nude scenes--when he wears a loose, constantly  shifting diaper--while she runs her long talons over her glistening  torso--must've have accelerated pulses of all sexes back in this pre-Code  extravaganza. Fay Wray should have played Karen Morley's squealing heroine.  Silver-haired and elegant Lewis Stone makes an off-beat hero-adventurer.  Gorgeous photography by Tony Gaudio, comic book costumes by Adrian, art  deco settings by Cedric Gibbons make this a smash-hit from the first frame  to the last. Lots of flesh baring by Charles and the dark slaves. It's fun  to watch Myrna lash her whip over Starrett and her &quot;Nubian&quot;  slaves. Great quote: &quot;Will we ever understand this Eastern race?&quot

My brother, Henry, always said this was his favorite movie. He loved film noir...(although I didn't know what that was at the time) and, of course, he loved Richard Widmark in his role. Looking back, Widmark should have gotten the Academy Award for Best Suppporting Actor for this (he was nominated) but there are many Oscar "should'ves". If you like prison/gangster movies, classic film noir, Richard Widmark, Victor Mature and, of course, Brian Dunleavy, you've gotta see/own this...if you havn't/don't already

This episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap" is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise. Truthfully, "The Man Trap" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered "adult programming", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young).

jacques tati takes on the modern world in his second sally as the perpetually bewildered mr hulot. while the movie is very funny in its pokes at modernism (highlighted by the house of hulots sister with its newfangled "conveniences" and its hilarious spouting dolphin fountain), it drags some of its jokes out a tad too long, and several scenes (notably the garden party) would have benefited by judicious paring. still, the movie demands to be seen by anyone who is a fan of classic comedy.

A damn good picture...and what's wrong with it being slow?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I think this is a great film.  Many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it's running time (128 minutes), insisting it's too slow.  Almost ALL of Clint's films (the ones he's directed) run long.  The running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours (the longest being Bird, at 2 hours, 40 minutes).  Sure, the film isn't PC, but it was made in 1975, when you didn't have to be PC.  But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film.  These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic.  Clint did all his own stunts in these sequences, and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences.  And they are very intense to watch, because you know the actors are really up there.  No CGI in those days.  This is one of the reasons they work so well.  CGI looks fake anyway.  It makes movies seem like cartoons.  People know it isn't real.  CGI reliance should be reduced in Hollywood, as it takes the tension out of action scenes.

The Eiger Sanction Holds Up
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Clint Eastwood's "The Eiger Sanction" was made in 1975 and was, at that time, an excellent action thriller. Viewing it again recently, I was surprised at how well it has held up. This is due mostly to the location shoots - filmed in Monument Valley and in the Swiss Alps instead of on a Hollywood soundstage. These guys really went up there and filmed those climbing sequences for real (including star and director Eastwood, who was about 45 at the time), and that just can't be faked. The spy story is also pretty good, there is an excellent supporting performance by Jack Cassidy, and Vonetta McGee and George Kennedy lend solid support. Also, John Williams' pre-Star Wars score is hauntingly jazzy and suspenseful. Check this one out

How to steal a million was a light-hearted farce starring too skilled performers in their own right.  Audrey Hepburn is delightful as the sweetheart bedazzled by Peter O'Toole an expert in forged art works.  The two have you rooting for them in their improbable caper.  Once you remind yourself that this is all just healthy fun than you can enjoy their performances.  Greed becomes almost a worthy attribute as they endeavor to outwit the perfect security system guarding unknowingly a fake artwork.  It is all good fun as the security system is foiled without harming a hair on anyone's head.  Dishonesty doesn't enter your mind as the caper comes to a pleasant climax.  Everyone ends up with their reputation intact and some spare change jingling in their pockets.  The two stars are engaging and carefree and are so effortless in their actions that they are a joy to watch.  Mind candy doesn't necessarily have to rot your brain.  It can give you some mindless enjoyment on a quiet night

When you consider the physical condition Olivier was in, his performance is pretty damn good. The supporting cast are mostly excellent, with Diana Rigg a standout as a venal, vicious, voracious, yet strangely feline and alluring Regan, and Dorothy Tutin not far behind as a grabby and lustful Goneril. Leo McKern is the definitive Gloucester

Romeo & Juliet ~ Leonard Whiting

This was purchased for my daughter for her 15th Birthday.  She is very deeply interested in Shakespeare and all his works but especially Romeo and Juliet.  I saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors.  I thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now.  Impressive that Mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not Mom's thing.

Brian DePalma pays homage to himself and creates a masterpiece for film buffs...all others beware!

After an elaborate theft scheme at the Cannes film festival goes terribly wrong Rebecca Romijn Ex-Stamos must go into hiding.She assumes a new identity but 7 years later a photographer threatens to expose her unless she can outwit him.Full of twists,deceit and secrets where nothing is as it seems don't expect a  plot or memorable performances.Rebecca is incredibly sexy but along with the rest of the cast she's just a pawn in DePalma's clever mindbender.A huge Hitchcock fan DePalma is best at stylish suspense scenes with no dialogue(like the 15 minute opening scene at the Cannes film festival in this film)and nicely includes elements of his and Hitchcock's previous films from Vertigo to Dressed to Kill.It's a lot of fun spotting the cinematic references and on repeated viewings you'll notice plenty of sneaky touches.If you're looking for an actionpacked straightforward suspense film you won't like Femme Fatale.If however you're looking for a twisty challenging film Femme Fatale will reward your attention

</Text>

Most of the other reviews printed here I am in agreement with.  There is little I need to add except that I saw the film for the first time in the eighties when it came out on tape.  I just rewatched it and still find my gut reaction to be the same and then some.  Schlesinger's work, the three leads and the marvelous script make for an engrossing, sobering and disturbing treatise on how so many people lack values and seek "happiness" in all of the wrong places -- especially in the wrong people.  After the twenty-odd years of first viewing this film, I realized tonight how strong Julie Christie's performance is in this film.  There is not one hole in this bravura performance.  It's odd to make this statement, especially since she's playing such a shallow role.  It's not an easy nor a desirable part to play, but she carries it off as if she herself were the character.  Selfishness is at the core of the character as well as immaturity, and she stoops and conquers.

La Ciudad
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I found La Ciudad a very different movie from any other movies I have wathched. This movie is split into four narratives of Latino immigrants living in the city of New York. Immigrants come to the US with many dreams in their minds. These dreams include getting higher education or getting thier childeren higher education, getting rich, and living a happy and high standard life. This movie shows how these dreams of immigrants are turned down and broken because of the exploitations at thier workplace and the laws of the city and the government. This movie also shows how the immigrant children are affected from these laws and exploitations. For example, Luis's daughter Dulce cannot get addmission to school, and Ana cannot do anything to treat her ill daugheter who is not with Ana. I like it how the movie is shown in black and white; it really matches with the narratives that are shown in the movie. It also indicates that although immigrants hope to have happy and colorful lives in the US, they are not able to have them because of the laws and exploitations. Overall, I really liked the movie and I would encourage anyone to see it

I came to this film after rave reviews from friends, so perhaps I was expecting too much. There is much to admire here; the acting is top-notch, the contrast between chatty characters and completely silent people in the opening interview scenes is well-crafted, and the plot premise itself is a fascinating one. For me, films are all about endings, and I felt in this area After Life didn't quite pay off. I didn't really buy into the romance, and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so I could care more whether she gets the guy or not.  I also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me. However, these are minor criticisms; it is a film I will watch again, and recommend to Japanese film fans, especially those who like the more slow-paced Japanese films such as Eureka, Moe no Suzaku and Sonatine

Shakespeare on film doesn't get much better
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I always have a soft spot in my heart for film adaptations of Shakespeare.  They are always labors of love, often cribbed together by excellent actors and technicians working well-below scale just for the sheer thrill of working with the Bard.  Even the less-successful productions, such as Mel Gibson's turn as the Prince of Denmark or the recent update of "Love's Labours Lost" win my affection if not my undying devotion.

Can the book reviewers please pay attention. This is not the book, this is the VHS movie section. I see many book reviews, but not a single movie review.

What about this VHS movie? Has anyone actually seen it? Also can someone tell me how to get people to sell it for a reasonable price. Used rental copies for $22 to 125 is outrageous. One can only hope it comes out on DVD and these scalpers lose money

This film is primarily a screwball comedy with dance and song numbers thrown in for good measure.  The story concerns a ballet star(Fred Astaire) and a stage performer(Ginger Rogers) who may or may not be married depending on whom you ask.  Given the celebrity of the two parties involved hijinks and scandal ensue.  Both Fred and Ginger are in top comic form with their verbal sparring.  Need we redundantly state that they dance together exquisitely.  Good supporting cast includes the perpetually nervous Edward Everett Horton, the droll Eric Blore, and Jerome Cowan("The Maltese Falcon").  Good score by the Gershwin brothers.  You do not hear much about this film in the annals of screwball comedy probably because the principals are known primarily for their dancing.  Check this film out if you want to see a first rate comedy

I had seen this film a number of times either on T.V. or by me popping it in on my DVD player. Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury are a pleasure to watch in this engaging story about a love affair between a  Africa American male and an Indian woman, whom both has never been to there native land, and how their romance causes strife in a small Southern town.  The movie handles the reactions by both families to the interracial union of Mina and Demetrius. Against all this, a subplot in the story revolves around the loss of a homeland and friendship between Choudhury's proud Ugandan national father and the Black Ugandan friend he left behind during Idi Amin's reign of terror.

Bresson's greatest work...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is Bresson's greatest, and last, work.  It is a work from a true cinematic auteur.  No one made films like Bresson did, and I don't think anyone ever will.  This film is based on a short story by Tolstoy entitled The Forged Coupon (aka The Forged Note), except Tolstoy's story is much different that Bresson's take here.  It is about how a forged note of 500 francs passes from one hand to another, ruining the life of a fuel oil delivery man.  Bresson made this film when he was 82, but you couldn't tell that it was made by a man that old.  Quite often, critics assume that filmmakers (and artists in general) have nothing to say as they get older.  On the contrary.  They have even more to say.  A real artist's vision deepens as they grow older.  Kurosawa made Ran at 75, and Eastwood made Million Dollar Baby at 74.  Those are their best films.  Bresson is rather feisty and combative (which is a good thing) in the interviews presented here.  He doesn't mince words, and he doesn't seem interested in doing the usual inane questions that featurettes on DVD's usually have from bubble headed reporters (even though these were shot for French TV, not Entertainment Tonight).  He has something to say.  This is my favorite film of his (even though Lancelot of the Lake and Au Hasard Balthazar are close behind).  Sadly, he never made another one after this, but the 13 he did make are all brilliant.  Not one bad one.  Great film, great man...

Fred Astaire met Ginger Rogers on the set of a previous film, FLYING DOWN TO RIO, where they were paired somewhat arbitrarily in one of those momentous decisions that, or so it seems from today's perspective, made the studio system seem to make sense.  You couldn't have really predicted the two would click on camera, for Fred's previous partner had been his own sister, and the two of them (Fred and Adele) had concentrated on the slightly nutty, zany dances together that did not require any sexual tension between partners.  (Think of the "Triplets" number in THE BAND WAGON.)

Most serious directors and actors aspire to a level of professionalism that seems effortless to the point of casual.  Like the best baseball outfielders catching swirling flyballs with a nonchalant jog and a flick of the wrist.  On the other hand, Kinski and Herzog want you to feel every moment of effort, every muscle twitch, the oppresive heat, the mind-numbing glassy eyed exhaution,  the dangerous waters, & the sleepless nights. Watching this movie, I can easily imagine the furious arguments and sullen bitterness of men pushed to their creative and physical limits. They suffered to make this movie and they want you to know it.  Herzog's actors tolerate conditions and exertions far beyond the call of duty and for what?  To make a flick.  Aguirre's men tolerated far more for gold most didn't live to see.  At the heart is the titular character, played by Kinski as a wild eyed wraith more dead than alive as he descends into an utter madness as a refuge against the ordeal and death he presides over.  To know anything about Kinski is to know that Aguirre is not a terrible stretch for him.  If anything, his performance is more brave in its selfexamination than creative in its acting chops. Herzog, for his part, seems to be a good old-fashioned meglomaniac as he appears to derive great satisfaction from pushing his cast and crew far beyond normal limits and treating them like little toy people so he can be a rich famous director. He has a singular vision and is determined to see it on the screen, no matter what.  He is a throwback to the American studio director/petty tyrants like John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock (a gentleman tyrant who referred to actors as cattle), Michael Curtiz and many others.  Herzog is determined to control and Kinski resists control and their collaborations are the output of a kind of two brained insane but brilliant filmmaker. Aguirre is almost two movies.  One is a brillant study of madness and ordeal and the other is an equally fascinating, if unintentional, documentary of two difficult half mad professional collaborators making a great movie often in spite of themselves

This video gives insight into the life and persona of Picasso.  While it touches on his climb to fame, recognition and success in the art world, it focuses primarily on his personal relationships.  I love his work, but I  sure wouldn't have wanted to live with him!  The video had therapuetic  effects for me; I would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly  calls into question your own view of relationships, how they are and how  they should and shouldn't be. A winner all the way around

A military classic
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This book is not about the grand strategy of war nor is it specifically about the heroic actions of its author, Audie Murphy, who was, of course, America's most decorated soldier of  World War II.  On the contrary, the book is about the war as seen up close and personal by those who actually fought it in the foxholes, on the roads and in the forests, and many times on the open battle fields of North Africa and Europe.

Aside from the rather chintzy quality of the disc itself, (WHY oh WHY don't they re-release the Special Edition again???) The film is fantastic. Kris Lemche is, as always, sarcastically funny and somehow very real and relate-able, Katherine Isabelle is quite convincing in her portrayals of madness and mayhem, and Emily Perkins is uniquely lovable as the younger sister trying to save her sibling from the woes of Lycanthropy. Tightly edited, and beautiful in it's cinematography, this is one indie horror flick you don't want to miss!!!

Like everyone says, this is a very strange story.    It seems to be a love-triangle, but there are more angles than three. For about half the film I thought Glenn Ford was meant to be in love with the Ballin Mundson (Ballin Mundson?) character, because he saved Ford's life (what for?), then gave him a job and was good to him. So far, so odd, but relatively simple to understand. When Rita shows up things become extremely complicated: incomprehensible in fact.  Who had run out on who, and why? I think we should have been told. Was it something to do with Rita's earlier line of work?  A lot of blame was being put on Rita, but so far as I could see she wasn't doing much wrong. Well, maybe just a bit of a tease, but so lovely, sweet and tender you'd forgive her anything. Actually, nobody's motivation here was the slightest bit convincing.  Also, as somebody else has said, the plot reads as if someone put together the pieces left on the cutting-room floor after Casablanca. Anyway, two-thirds into the story,  we get a totally alien sub-plot about conquering the world by cornering the tungsten filament market, which we couldn't care less about, as it has  nothing to do with the tensions between the three main players.  This part is boring and even more unconvincing than the original triangle. The sinister Mr Mundson looked good in his part, but it seemed as if he wasn't being allowed to get his teeth into the role.  Glenn Ford has never impressed me as a personality. He never seems to have what it takes: I can't imagine Rita falling for him, nor can I believe he could take out heavies with his puff-ball punches. I can't even believe he'd behave like the nasty little swine he's supposed to be. So why have I watched this movie two or three times, and why will I watch it again? Only one answer: you said it, folks --- Rita Hayworth.

I haven't read them all, but it seems to me that most of the reviews here are about film technique. In addition to being ground-breaking from a director's standpoint, it's a great story. I've seen the Richard Gere version, and frankly, all I remember about it is the MTV music video for the theme song. The original gave me a completely different perception of the story, and the ending surprised me. I thought Jean-Paul Belmondo did a fantastic job with a complex character. There's a press conference scene that I thought was important to the story, as well. I wish I spoke French, because I think there are nuances in the dialogue not captured in the subtitles, but nevertheless, I think this is an enjoyable film in addition to all the cinematic masterpiece accolades.

A schizophrenic journey through the dark urban world. Michael, A young writer, comes from a dysfunctional household and uses his cartoons as an outlet. Eventually he begins to delve himself into his dark toon world and the movie is beautifully animated and stuffed full of creativity, sex, bigotry, and ultimately a true grim view of society. As dark as it sounds I found parts of this movie very amusing. Housewives, pass on this one it's not 'Finding Nemo'. If you enjoy a truly stunning visual experience and dark humor/satire I'd reccomend you watch this....A true must see for the inebriated

I really did like this movie and the different kind of story. It was very imaginative and well acted. The story was very scarey at times and gorey as well. The only problem with the movie is that the director covered up Ezra Godden's nude scene with a half shot of his butt in the begining of the movie. Other than that, if you would like to see a town that prays to a fish god Dagon that wants human sacrafices and the town's people peeling off the faces of it's visitors then this movie is for you

The Plus Factor

I saw a high school production of BRIGADOON in San Francisco at the ICA (Immaculate Conception Academy) at 24th and Guerrero.  These girls who played the parts had never been anywhere near Scotland, you could tell, and some had not been in the USA very long and the charming accents of South of the Border stood in for the strong Scots burr.  Nevertheless they played the show beautifully and ever since then I have had a fondness for the music and the story.  I feel that the makers of MOULIN ROUGE were probably trying to capture some of the big-hearted appeal of BRIGADOON when they created their fantasy world.  Watching the movie I have always felt that a bit of the magic was lost because so much of Minnelli's canvas was spent on dance elements which, IMHO, are just not that interesting.  So many dance numbers created to take advantage of Gene Kelly's and Cyd Charisse's astonishing abilities.  Maybe too many!  Thus some of the musical numbers had to be cut out, including some of the loveliest of the songs Lerner and Loewe wrote for the 1947 musical.

A timely meditation on the absurdity of war
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
At this moment in our history we need all the input about the multiple facets of the hideous War Machine that has an apparent strangle hold on every country on the planet.  In this Russian meditation, 100 DAYS BEFORE THE COMMAND, we are shown the behind-locked-doors view of youth preparing to become soldiers and leaders of soldiers.  On the surface the director's eye seems to be telling us that 'boot camp' for these VERY young appearing boys is no more than a summer camp experience.  But then he gradually shows the darker, terrifying side of what preparing these innocents for war produces - suffering, self-doubt, death, alienating behaviour, dreams and nightmares.  There is an incredible sense of innocence in the eyes of these youth, and a groping for comradery that lightly brushes on eroticism.  The multiple nude scenes seem to be offending more people than the Russian censors, but they are some of the more tender and tangible scenes in this meandering film about questioning our place and mindsets in the propagation of war leaders.  Of note, in this very Russian film, the music used in the background is all Bach - excerpts form the Passions, cantatas - instead of works by Russian composers.  This adds another dimension to this apparent 'paean' for world peace.  This film is not for everyone, especially not for those who still have difficulty with male nudity........

This movie was much better than I expected. With all the nonsense about the "NC-17" rating wooooo, I thought it was gonna be all T&A and more. Not that I don't like that, but the movie was exactly what Siskel & Ebert were saying at the time: A movie that has a plot and sexuality. NOT porn, but a truly ADULT movie. This is a movie that deals with grown up issues regarding sexuality, marriage and fidelity.

Dated, cheezy, but still better than "Rudy"
</Text>
</title>

This movie has a very high "cheese" factor. The most glaring example being when the Notre Dame player scores a touchdown in the 1928 Army game after Rock's rousing "Win One for the Gipper" speech, looks to the sky and says "That's one for the Gipper!" That aside, this is a great movie! It is way better than "Rudy"!!! After all, Rudy's Notre Dame playing career lasted less than even 30 seconds!!! This is the story of the story of the one man who actually BUILT the program for crying out loud!!!! If it wasn't for Rock, Rudy would have never happened! I'll take this story over the one about a hapless janitor any day!!!

A Majormovie for Meyer
</Text>
</title>

Being a fan of Russ Meyer movies since classics like "Mudhoney", "Vixen" and "Lorna" it is amazing what happens, when Russ gets some money to make a movie for a major company. Likewise italian competitor Tinto Brass Russ gets in feel with picturing "Erotic" in a slight different way. I liked this movie very much for it's blooming 60's Pop-feeling and great decent inszenation of the participated women. I'm in general a fan of exploitation movies and this one is an especially great one presentated on DVD with a great transfer and lots of extras. Well Done. (Hope my english is half the way understandable, sorry I'm german)

I recently viewed this film when it was broadcast on television, and I must say that it was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Part of the spy genre, Quiller travels to Berlin to investigate the resurgence of a group of Nazis and it is necessary for him to uncover where their base is located. As with any spy thriller, it is difficult at times to differentiate between a supposed friend and and an enemy. One keeps wondering if Quiller is indeed placing his trust on the right people, particularly those who claim to be on his side. Quiller is a spy who doesn't carry a gun, noting that he is less likely to be killed if he is not armed. Despite his intelligence and wit, he still gets caught in precarious situations. Impeccable acting accompanied by astute dialogue make this a compelling piece to watch over and over again

FEEL GOOD MOVIES - REVIEW NR. 1
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
AFTER 81 YEARS, I HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE UP ON THE GREAT DRAMATIC MOVIES THAT PRESENT THE WORLD IN ALL ITS MASSIVE TURMOIL.  I GET ALL THAT FROM NEWSPAPERS, PERIODICALS, RADIO, TELEVISIOPN AND NOW, EVEN THE INERNET.  I WANT TO WATCH MOVIES THAT I CALL "FEEL GOOD" MOVIES. THESE MOVIES CEMNTER ON A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH A FEW INSIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS AND THEN, OVER THE COURSE OF AN HOUR OR SO, WORKOUT THE KINKS OF THIER LIVES AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.  THESE MOVIES CAN BE FULL OF PATHOS OR BATHOS OR EVEN SLAP STICK COMDEDY, BUT THEY NEVER PRESENT YOU WITH ANY PROBLEM GREATER THAN HOW TO GET YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW TO BABYSIT THE KIDS BUT NOT MOVE IN WITH YOU...UNLESS YOU WANT HER TO.  COLD COMFORT FARM MEETS MY CRITERIA TO BE CLASSIFID AS A "FEEL GOOD" MOVIE.

This episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap" is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise. Truthfully, "The Man Trap" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered "adult programming", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young).

I seen it a few months back then, to my dismay it was on again the same time as RAW, but instead I recorded it anyways. It does a very good job of creating a nightmare Orwellian future, without making the people seem too paranoid for the most part. The scenes of the President talking on TV were very powerful. It strongly reminded one of a "Big Brother lite." Yes there is violence and a love story and rebels risking their lives for a better future.

This is my first Bergman.  (And I did not pay $36 for it.  I bought it for 99 cents on eBay, completely new, played fine.)  I bought several Bergmans (almost all from eBay, they're very expensive otherwise)when his name kept popping up in connection with Woody Allen, a hero of mine.  I liked this movie very much, it was warm and soothing and interesting.  I was struck at first with the simplicity of the symbols and the extremely detailed direction (e.g. when the old man starts while leaving the room to move a chess piece, then changes his mind and continues on out of the room).  I have 6 of his films left to watch and I'm looking forward to them, particularly the ones with dubbed in English, which most of them are.  As for its being similar to a Woody Allen flick, all that comes to mind is "Another Woman."  But I'll hold my tongue (fingers), I have 6 more to see.  What really does come to mind, and the reason I gave this flick such a mediocre rating, is "A Christmas Carol"!  It's better than I ever thought Dickens was, but the Dickens came first.  I loved the movie until I realized that

I had not heard of this production, so I had no expectations of it.  I am a fan of the BBC literature miniseries, and the lead actor in this had a small, disagreeble role in "Wives and Daughters."  What a nice surprise to see him in such a positive role, so charming and sincere.  He is wonderful here, complex and layered.

I really enjoyed this movie however one of the more interesting parts of the movie was not fully developed.  Ian Mckellen's character was supposed to be homosexual .....he is in love with Vincent Perez's character.  It was a pretty subtle subplot in the movie and while I was watching it I was thinking....hmmmm is Ian Mckellen's character gay? I read Roger Ebert's review of the movie on [...]. In his article Ebert says the movie could have been more interesting if this plot was further developed....I agree. I really enjoyed the movie but I thought Ian Mckellen's character was very interesting and if his desires were further explored it could have turned this fairly ordinary romance movie into an extraordinary movie

To begin with, I wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol!  That said, this is a rare case (the 1st of its kind?) of a movie being better than the play it was based on.  The general framework was of course the same, but in the play Judy Holliday's part was taken by Josephine Hull, a very funny little old lady (who also scored both on Bway and on the screen in "Harvey" and "Arsenic and Old Lace," to name the only 2 that I know of), and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges, it blossomed in the film.  One problem, there simply were no witty lines, either in the play or the movie.  This is odd for Kaufman (though the play was produced in 1953, very late in his career), but about par for Burrows (early in his career).  But still it was clever and interesting, the play had more structure than the movie (typical of Kaufman), but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play, which surprised me very much and made me wonder about Kaufman.  Also the flick left out all the naughty words which I'm sure Hull barked out with delicious abandon!  (Note:  Kaufman co-wrote the play, Burrows adapted it for the screen.)  This I think was more a sit-com than an actually witty Kaufman comedy.  And finally, Judy Holliday did NOT play a "dumb blonde"!  She only did that in "Born Yesterday.

Sure, it would have been great if the Chuck Jones and Dr. Seuss  alliance would have continued for this outing (their "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" and "Horton Hears A Who" are unquestionable classics) but this is a noble effort.. a VERY noble effort.  "The Cat in the Hat" was always been my favorite Dr. Seuss book. Having said that, I felt the top notch vocal talent (Allan Sherman will forever be the Cat in the Hat, sorry Mike Meyers!) and whimsical screenplay really fleshed out the book playful theme ... and the Geisel penned songs were truly inspired!  So the animation is a little off.  This is going to be considered quite the classic when that stinker of a movie opens this winter

When I was little, I remembered this show before I read the original Cat in the Hat.  I was enanmored by the animation of the great late Chuck Jones and the wonderful vocals of Allan Sherman as the Cat in the Hat.  If you see the credits, Theodore Geisel had his hand in the music.  I recently bought the sing-a-long tape for my daughter, Grace, who is 3 years old.  She requests to see it, so hopefully the new DVD will be a great asset if it has extra features such as interviews or even behind the scenes of one of the best animation short classics ever

I first stumbled across this movie on cable in the late 80's. I loved it then and still do today. Great story, great casting, great acting & great period film making. Diane Lane is not to shabby either as a strippin' diva with a taste for the fast life. Matt Dillon plays a complete craps stud who can win any dice game no matter the stakes or cash on the table. Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Skerrit, Bruce Dern & Lee Grant all contribute with awesome performances to this "Gem Club" of a movie. I sincerely hope we'll all be lucky enough for this title to be available soon on DVD. Heck, I'd love to have a DVD with tons of extras too if it was up to me but it it's not. I can always dream though..

This was purchased as a gift for a co-worker who is adopting a child from China.  Therefore I did not open it nor view it.  The recipient is now overseas picking up their daughter so I know they haven't had the opportunity to view it.  But being from Sesame Street, what can you lose

History by a Great Story Teller
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is far too big and rich a film to be contained in any summary description. It is rich in its beautiful depictions of childhood, family, and of sexual love, rich in its narrative of the growth of fascism, and fascist personalities, in pre-WW II Italy, rich in its analysis of the unjust relationship between the owners and the workers of Italy's farm lands, rich in the beauty of its sets, costumes, and scenes. It is a rough, rambling, long film, badly dubbed in the English version, but it is also an indispensable, inimitable, and immensely enjoyable journey through a vital part of modern European history. I saw the "short" version of the film shortly after its release in 1977--it did not have a long run in the United States--and never forgot it. I saw it again, just now, thirty years later, but this time, the director's much longer cut. It had lost none of its power.

DOESN'T DESERVE NEGLECT
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Although given short shrift by the few critics who watched it, this is a worthy effort, marked by good acting, direction, technicals, and an intelligent script. Although in a state of undress through much of the film, Kelly Lynch is given an opportunity to display the full panoply of her acting range as there are essentially only two actors. And, as so often with independent films, all involved have an opportunity to be truly creative. The desert setting enhanced the starkness of the extreme emotions to which the viewer is exposed.

I think it's kind of poetic that I ended up getting the film adaption of Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451". It was because I couldn't find the book anywhere! I don't know how good it is as an adaption, but I found the film thought provoking, well directed and clever.

A little heavy handed, but still really interesting portrait of problems in schools
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
187 is a strange movie about schools.  It's strange because this is one of the few pictures that looks at a teacher's perspective of the system and it's strange because it's not a rosy picture of schools.  Jackson's portrayal of Trevor Garfield paints a picture of a nervous, worried teacher who was passionate about teaching, but is now scared of the slightest sound, continually checking the corner of his eye, as he's been faced with a near fatal attack a year earlier.

True female bonding on this film
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
When Foxfire first came out, I had no interest to watch it at all. Recently I became a huge Angelina Jolie fan. The main reason to watch the movie was her. Jolie is great as usual. She gives everything into her character and is very good. The reason that films like these don't get as much publicity as their male counterparts is because they are all are so stereotyped and labeled. And while the generalization about most "female bonding" films is true, the same could be said about the men. And what makes each film stand apart is the emotion and ideas of the characters. The plot is based on real life situations, and the characters and the charisma they deliver is what makes the film so liberating and exciting to watch. The girls are learning life lessons, growing up, experimenting, facing hard issues and learning to cope and understand each other.

I have watched this movie again and again, and I can't imagine a better Carmen than Rita Hayworth!  Her Carmen is a free spirit, proud, sensual, intelligent, and yet vulnerable too.  Glenn Ford may have been slightly miscast as Don Jose, but he and Rita had such a chemistry that they make this film work.

The Eye of Morning
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
Mata Hari arrived in Paris and soon began to spin a web of sorcery. Her naked body (that same body that was later to be riddled with bullets)her password to a greedy world of material success.Margaretha Geertruida Zelle MacLeod enjoyed a happy childhood in Holland the darling of a dotting father. Early restlessness brought her to Java, the mail-bride of a brute. There, in Indonesia, amid crushing tragedy and spousal abuse, Gertie absorbed the artistic concepts that will one day found her applauded, then, mowed down by a French firing squad. Poor judgment, and Eastern flair, and a gluttony for men, contrived to make her eternal. But was Gertie a spy? The visionary Irving Thalberg secured the rights to Mata Hari's notebooks and thus MGM began production starring Greta Garbo. I find this 1932 film a work of contrasts. To watch Garbo mise-en-scene through the lens of William Daniels, in a genial atmosphere assembled by Cedric Gibbons, rapturous, is truly a fine thing. MGM's 'Mata Hari' remains a unique accomplishment. Though one wonders how the silly story-theme ever passed Thalberg. There is a dichotomy here, style versus substance (a chronic blemish with some of Garbo's films) The developing narrative is puerile, and mind you, the early thirties boasts many a gritty film. More than an actress Garbo is a virtuosa, a poseur. Thus she offers art more priceless, a curious and singular spiritual apogee, such pulchritude and distinction. Watch her shoulders ache suddenly as she plays piano en-scene, as her stock-in-trade matinee idol grasps her from behind wantonly. Watch her match wits with Lewis Stone, tonight her spy-master. Watch Garbo in the third act climb the hospital stairs Adrian head-to-toe. Watch her watch her. But! if I hear Ramon Navarro one more time call her "...Mata!" I think I'd croak (her name is M-A-T-A-H-A-R-I) How many times I've seen 'Mata Hari' I'm ashamed to say. The last viewings have been in the wee hours where there reigns a sad and profound solitude. On cue Greta emerges, like Cybele, to temporarily soothe my ills. Soon, I hear a halting viola: "...I come to you Si-va! like the bayaderes dance in your sacred temples in Java...!" Mata Hari! Mata Hari! Mata Hari! Mata Hari

Hot view of the fall of imperialism

<text>
<Text>
Gibson and Weaver star in theis steamy view of the fall of imperialism in Indonesia.  They start living the expat life in Jakarta, and live the transformation as the country moves to military rule.  The movie is interesting on many fronts:  Seeing the leads before they became megastars, watching the subtle condemnation of expats amongst locals, and the history woven into the fiction.  Supporting roles are played superbly as well.  It's a great movie

To say this is a great film is probably an overstatement, but it certainly is a great idea for a film. Gibson looks good, Weaver looks good, Hunt acts good, Weir directs good, and the script is better than good. Much. It's a movie about ideas, which earns high marks these days, as so few flics can make that claim. Sure, it stumbles a bit, and the ending is purposely frustrating, to carry forward the theme of White Guilt and "What then shall we do?" Beyond all that, it's sensual, and unpredictable, and pretty damned intelligent. Seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill? I ain't. See it for yourself.

One of the greatest silent films
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
At the tine it was unsurpassed in spectacle and scope, and has held up remarkably well, despite a few touches of typical silent overacting/heavy-handedness. Still, the 1925 Hur belongs in any collector's collection for its importance in film history. Not to mention the fact that it sealed MGM's financial future. So of course, as of this writing, the greedy oinkers at the studios haven't released it on DVD because it won't sell 4 million copies

With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.

All 3 WIWAG are excellent. This is more than just a well put together documentary. Its very moving because of the footage, narration and music. You don't feel like you are watching a DVD about baseball. It feels like you are watching a snapshot of Americana from the 50's and 60's. After watching this, you wish that things today were as they were back in those days. Not just baseball or sports, but life in general as it was protrayed in the DVDs

Why the record company would put this out on VHS, and not DVD, is beyond me, especially considering its release date. The ultimate would be (and they have done it before, see both the Doors and Sepultura DVD releases) to take this, and add to it, Live at Brixton, and put it all on one DVD. Since this doesn't seem likely, I suggest, burn your own DVD, and include not only "Ricochet" and "Another Bloody Murder" (both left out), but also Mr. Bungle's one music video release. Happily, while "Stripsearch" is not listed on the back of the VHS box, it is included. FNM videos? GREAT, GREAT, GREAT..

Even though this cinderella does not have the modern day "movie magic", (in fact, the sets are pretty corny)...That does not hurt, or take away any of the  wonderful memories of when I was a little girl, and looked forward every year for the airing of "cinderella" and "The wizard of oz"  I was thrilled to have found this, and would highly, highly recomend it to any 40+ woman out there that has the memory of this wonderful version of cinderella. Leslie Ann Warren is simply timeless in this

We've seen several versions of Cinderella now and like this one the best. When my kids were smaller they liked the Disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the Disney version out the window. I personally really liked the Julie Andrews B & W version due to the GREAT singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the DVD plays

Can't You Hear The Wind Howl? A Vision of Robert Johnson

</title>
<text>
<Text>
I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen

I won't spend a long time explaining why I like this movie...it's just mindless fun and that's all it needs to be.  A movie about a bunch of overweight kids taking over after their fat-camp is sold into the hands of a crazed lunatic is enough reason to watch, and while it's not the funniest or clever done comedy it's a great kids movie with enough laughs for us adults to enjoy along with them.  Plus, that blob thing is just too freaking cool

I first saw the b&w original of "The Thing" in the late 50s (?), and was totally engrossed (jumped out of my seat with the rest of the audience, at one point) - so I knew generally what the plot might be. The story line and characters here were pretty much the same, dressed up in color and hi-tech research equipment. Nifty vistas of Alaska's bleak beauty, and a satisfying high-tech rendition of the half-uncovered alien saucer.

They weren't ugly, they were gorgous. I don't know why the director wanted to place those ugly masks over thier beauty, I mean not all witches are ugly!

A Good movie;A John Wayne movie with a very nice cast, the usual Harry Carye Jr.Ben Johnson,John Agar,Paul Fix and many other great people. Especially from the time it is great to see Merlin Olsen and Roman Gabriel from the Football movie actor Era. The added plus is we have Rock Hudson in the movie.Not to forget the movies leading ladies Lee Meriweather,Marian McCargo.The women are very nice looking  and they would be if they were in Rock Hudson's family. The time era of the film is after the American Civil War. John Wayne is your Northerner and Rock is from the South. The deep South. John Wayne is with his loyal men who are finanical ruined after the war and need to take home money to their families when they return.They band together to run a herd legally.The Rock is a family man who has lost everything even his country. The Southerns are lured to Mexico with false promises and high hopes. The Northerners are going to do business with Mexico also.John Wayne and the men end up helping the Southerns. Enemies but John Wayne and his men have honor and help the Southerners.Most importantly fellow Americans. The Civil War tore us apart and threw us together. There are great elements in the movie action,love,honor in people,human weaknesses,saddness,and some historical correctness. The movie is not anyone's best movie but it is not the worse either. Good entertainment with a good mix of plot and history. John Wayne and the Rock's only movie together. The movie shows everyone in such great shape and takes you back to great movie times.Watch and Enjoy

Maybe the finest life of Christ on film
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I  thought George Stevens' impeccably crafted and literate THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD (1965) was the finest life of Jesus Christ on film.  Then I took another look recently at director Nicholas Ray's KING OF KINGS (1961) and changed my mind.  I don't know what the best life of Jesus is, but KING OF KINGS has a charismatic and sympathetic Christ (Jeffrey Hunter in the performance of his career), a great John the Baptist (Robert Ryan), the definitive Salome's dance (luscious Brigid Bazlen) and the ultimate Sermon on the Mount (with 7,000 extras on a Spanish hillside), a striking Last Supper with disciples sitting at a Y-shaped bench, a strong Crucifixion, and a reverent Resurrection.  At 171 minutes (including ten minutes of Miklos Rozsa music), Samuel Bronston's production seems the ideal length to tell the story of Christ.  The screenplay is by Oscar winner Philip Yordan.

Derek Jarman's 'Sebastiane' is a momentous painting which is simply brushed on film rather than canvas. This is a master work and should be in any serious film buff's cabinet. (I should very much like to see it running continuously upon a smooth stone wall of a monumental pillared vestibule - perhaps like the Four Seasons in New York. It's visual beauty should be constantly on view.

one of mikio naruse's last masterpieces was 1960's &quot;when a woman ascends the stairs&quot; - it is also one of only two of the great director's films currently available in any video format in the u.s. but wow, what an introduction it is! this seemingly modest film about a woman on the edge of a precipice, winding her way through dismal back alleys and cheap bars in search of an out is one of the great character pieces in world cinema. crisply shot in black and white widescreen (which is admirably reproduced in this edition), this beautifully directed and acted film is an absolute must for anyone interested in movies. the sadness lies in the knowledge that this kind of film is not made anymore; there's no one talented enough to pull it off nearly as well. class and subtlety are a rare commodity and this film has just the right amount of both. it's perfect, one of the greatest films of all time, one i come back to again and again

When con man and general loser Eric Stanton (Dana Andrews) drifts into the small California ocean-side town of Walton late one night, he has dollar in his pocket and few prospects. Stanton wanders into the only diner open, Pops, to get a cup of coffee and something to eat. He meets Mr. Judd (Charles Bickford), a retired New York cop, and the waitress, Stella (Linda Darnell). Stanton soon finds himself up to his eyes in three things he didn't expect. He didn't expect to fall for Stella, a sullen beauty who is prepared to sell what men want for a wedding ring and a good life. He didn't expect to find himself on the run for Stella's murder...with a wife, June Mills (Alice Faye), a woman he married for her money so that he and Stella could eventually be together. Not only are the Walton cops after him, they've signed up Judd to help out, a smart, tough man who doesn't hesitate to punch up a suspect if that's what he thinks is needed. And Stanton sure didn't expect to ever find himself in a situation he couldn't talk himself out of.

This character Buckaroo Banzai played by Peter Weller is an incredible individual.  A well accomplished person who is half japanese, brain surgeon, scientist, martial artiste, and rock star.  He also knows how to ride a motorcycle. BB is backed up with a special hand picked team of men known as the" Blue Blazers".  In this episode they battle aliens from Planet 10 across the 8th Dimension.  John Lithgow stars as the demented Dr. Emilio Lizardo in one of his greatest roles.  Blue Blazer Regulars such as Perfect Tommy, Reno, Jersey, Rawhide, and Pinky Caruthers add to the amusement but Pacos is in Tibet. The characters are colorful.  As "another you", Ellen Barkin plays Penny Pretty who safeguards the overthruster.  Flaws with the script would be "Why would Orson Wells be giving the news during Halloween 1938 and changing it to H.G. Wells "War of the Worlds"?  I thought he did fiction like "Citizen Kane" not report news events of the era such as the tragedy of the Hindenburg Disaster for example.  Is Orson Wells related to H.G. Wells or Tom Cruise? The movie is entertaining.  We can see why Peter Weller today stars in documentaries on the History Channel.  I only wish there be re-issues of the "Kids From C.A.P.E.R."(Civilian Authority for the Protection of Everyone Regardless) Television Show originally aired back in 1975 and before they battled indians, the original "Ghostbusters" also '75 starting Larry Stork, Forrest Tucker, & Kong. The songtrack on these shows were great. BB & The Hong Kong Cavaliers are not The Monkeys. BB lacks a decent song track. At least we get to see the devote effort of saving mankind from world destruction armed only with slingshots, boyscout knives, and six shooters unlike today where Captain America can't even save himself or maybe it's because america is only doing a job we all know needs to be done.  The movie was put together well.  It is a classic.  Jeff Goldberg also appears in this film but I don't know why.  Anyway, "wherever you go, there you are"

I have owned the video for several years and just purchased the DVD.  Hannah and Her Sisters far exceeds Anne Hall as my favorite Allen picture.  Such a joy.  And the DVD is wonderful

This is a great movie for airplane buffs and those who enjoy comedy.  The filming and stunts are amazing.  To think this was the beginning of aviation.  A must see for anyone who appreciates comedy and/or aviation.  A family favorite at my house, one we view over and over.  The laughs never seem to stop

Cinderella Rocks

<Text>
We've seen several versions of Cinderella now and like this one the best. When my kids were smaller they liked the Disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the Disney version out the window. I personally really liked the Julie Andrews B & W version due to the GREAT singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the DVD plays

In 1997, forty years after Julie Andrews performed the title role LIVE in Rodgers and Hammerstein's TV production of Cinderella, R&B singer Brandy brought the role to life in TV's third incarnation of this musical classic, produced by The Wonderful World of Disney and Whitney Houston, who played the fairy godmother. Ratings were huge for the program, and it even won an Emmy.

Avatar is so awesome! I saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all. It's got an excellent story line, great characters and awesome animation. I'd say it's the best show on TV out there right now, not just considering the cartoons either. It's got a real depth to it and isn't only fit for kids but teenagers(like me) and adults alike. Highly recomended!

A fine film featuring absolutely first rate comic performances
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
MY FAVORITE WIFE is not among the very best comedies of pre-war Hollywood, but it is nonetheless quite excellent, driven by a strong script, superb lead performers, and a number of great character performances.  Cary Grant is the finest comic actor film has produced and this film demonstrates that as well as any.  Though he was equally as good in classics such as BRINGING UP BABY and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, those films were so marvelously directed, so superbly well written, and filled with such an overabundance of great actors that one might not notice just how outstanding Grant was (that is not the case with HIS GIRL FRIDAY, where even among an embarrassment of riches, Grant stands out and dominates the film).  Here Grant is surrounded by fewer talented actors, is working with a slightly less superb (though still quite good) script, and is directed by the writer instead of the director originally scheduled for the project.  Originally the plan was to reunite Grant, Irene Dunne, and Leo McCarey, the big threesome of the classic 1937 screwball THE AWFUL TRUTH.  Unfortunately, McCarey had a car wreck just before shooting was begun and was unable to be on the set.  Canin did a good if not spectacular job.  Unlike his fellow writers Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges, both of whom became fulltime directors of their own scripts around this time, Canin primarily remained a writer for the rest of his career.

A little known documentary that is both entertaining and informative. Touching first hand accounts and rare footage that give an extraordinary look at both Mr. Welles and the Brazilian culture. If there is one reason  to own this tape it would be to see over and over again the last part of  the film. A piece called &quot;Four Men on a Raft&quot; It is the most  beautiful black and white short film I have ever seen. The love Mr. Welles  had for these poor fishermen is so wonderfully apparent

Kathryn Bigelow obviously put a lot of care into her direction of this film.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I'm absolutely shocked that the critical reaction to this movie has been so negative. I was overwhelmed by `The Weight of Water.' I guess part of the problem is that the ad campaign seems to have presented it as a thriller, which it's not. It's also not a mystery or a love story. It's a slow-paced, decidedly downbeat look at two women who are trapped in loveless relationships. Basically, it consists of two parts, a modern-day part and a historical part, set in the 19th century. The 19th century part shows promise and actually gives a pretty interesting view of how a mysterious double murder took place, but ultimately it's underdeveloped and I'll have to admit is a bit slow.

Only The Lonely is  a good romantic comedy type movie that has a great cast that includes, John Candy, Ally Sheedy, Maureen O'Hara, Anthony Quinn and Milo O'Shea. The movie is about a Irish American cop who lives in Boston with his over bearing overly opinionated mother and he falls in love with a woman who is mother doesn't like. This is a cute movie and I'm glad that they finally have put it on DVD

A group of male pals are at the wedding of a friend.  When he gets married, Jerry O'Connell, (as &quot;Michael&quot;) and the rest of the men agree to never get married, be single and be a &quot;Tomcat&quot;.  Horatio Sanz (as &quot;Steve&quot;) agrees too, but the next thing they know, he gets married too.  Michael and Steve are still friends.  Everytime Michael meets a woman, bad luck happens and he gets in trouble with thugs or the law.  He's a innocent as can be.  Horatio Sanz (NBC's Saturday Night Live) is hilarious and a delight in this film. Billy Hufsey plays a &quot;Pit Boss&quot;

Renoir's first venture into color
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
In Jean Renoir's introduction to this film the great master cites Rumer Godden's book The River as the greatest work of literature about English colonialism in India. I can think of at least two books that are greater, E.M. Forster's A Passage to India, and George Orwell's Burmese Days, two works of literature which seem to indicate that Britain's endeavors in India produced more harm than a few damaged human relations among the English.

Most of the movie, the parts that work anyway, is like a visual kei band's music video, and it's nice to have that kewl aesthetic without the bad music that usually accompanies it. The movie's concept is something that could have only come from asia, where filmmakers seem to digest american influences and refashion them into something that seems to miss the whole point of what made the original ideas work. The kooky Face/Off being a prime example of this insanity. The cop movie setup seems like needless window dressing, anchoring the visually oriented fantasy content in a reality it needn't have any relevence to, but I guess even Alice In Wonderland, Labyrinth, and the Nightmare On Elm Street series used the device of having it be all in a dream. It's not a story driven movie and to grade it as such would be unfair. It's a surrealist visual art project, something that barely exists in cinema, and although it would be better placed in the context of some worthwhile characters and plot, it is making progressive and original use of the film medium. It's much like The Corpse Bride in that regard, except this film will weird you out with twists of random insanity instead of bore you with tedius monotony and musical numbers. Criticisms from one-star reviewers such as "pure eye candy, no story" couldn't be more accurate, but if you'd ever go to look at an art exhibit, this film is equally worth a look.

Two Acting Powerhouses!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I love it when two of my favorite actors are in a movie together. When one's off screen, you have the other to keep you entertained. And when they're on screen together, it's movie-making at its best. The plot itself leaves a bit to be desired. The film's production was stop-and-go for so long, I heard that the director changed direction before it was finished. My guess is that some of what was lost was what was missing from the movie, particularly in regards to understanding Benicio's character properly. Nonetheless, Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro shine throughout.

This movie was made mainly to potray the cycle of Jesus' Christ life, and what he when through, sacrificing himself for our sins. People may think that it may be too religous for their standards, but everyone has their own beliefs. I highly recommend you view the film it is very innovating and emotional. Being a christian myself everytime I watch this film it uplifts my spirits and I hope it will do the same with yours

This is a very funny movie and I honestly laughed so hard I was crying.   had never even heard of any of the comedians except for Jeff Foxworthy, and I had only heard some of his "You might be a redneck..." jokes.  Ron White is just plain down and out funny. His timing is wonderful, and you don't get what you expect. You do laugh a lot, and you need to put down your beer before he starts talking, lest you blow it out your nose!

genderlect?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Colin Firth plays a teacher and passionate to the point of obsessive football (soccer for Americans) fan who manages to mangle his only functional relationship, thanks to his tunnel vision when it comes to his obsession and fanatical support for Arsenal. His self-centered attitude with no concern at all for his girlfriend's interests muck up what could be a good relationship. On the other hand, it is hard to see in the first place what the woman finds so appealing about Firth's character, Paul. Perhaps because she is so uptight and needs to loosen up and sees in him a way by which to learn to be less rigid. She attempts to get involved in HIS passion but does not quite have the rabid, feverish passion he has. Eventually the fact that he identifies himself so closely with his football club and its ups and downs leads to the demise of the relationship, but she comes to see that she likes his identity, which is strong, linked to football or not. She has also been carried away by a certain infectious passion about football because it is so much a part of his life. Of course, one could argue that this tale is a sad reflection on the idea that there is a genderlect and that women suffer more in terms of being able to communicate, but that belies the point here that sometimes an imperfect person can still be perfect for someone who loves him, faults, obsessions and all

Monroe on Steroids
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Frank Tashlin and Jayne Mansfield-- a marriage made in cartoon heaven. Who better to point up the absurdities of pop culture,1950's style, than Mansfield, with her little girl squeal, breathy delivery, and protruding gunboats. She resembles nothing so much as Marilyn Monroe on steroids. And Tashlin, with his gift for social satire and cartoonist eye for exaggeration. Notice how cleverly sight gags are inserted to stress a point-- an overheated kiss that pops popcorn, a computer read-out that mimics the dialogue, celebrity-mad teen-agers that pour out of a man-hole. Notice too, how in the end, Tashlin confronts the glamorous but artificial world of advertising with the unglamorous but authentic world of living things. In a subtle way, Tashlin's subtext undermines the image-obsessed 50's by anticipating the back-to-nature 1960's. All in all, the movie remains a revealing document of its time.

</Text>
</title>
<text>

Why do I call this film the best Jayne Mansfield movie?.Well,it is the largest-budget film she ever appeared in + The Film was HERS.The Studio had paid quite a bundle for that play,that basically put Ms. Mansfield on the map.Even 'The Girl Can't help it'(also a great movie),was padded (no pun intended Jaynie!) with rock'n roll numbers,because the Studio was scared that Jayne  could not carry the film alone(Were they ever wrong !).

Well, of course it's that hokey romantic type.  And, of course you see the ending coming from a mile away.  Of course we've seen it all before.  But, as far as entertainment value goes, it's got it.  Reese Witherspoon proves, once again, that she can flesh out an otherwise empty character and give it some personality.  There's really not much to the characters in this movie, but there doesn't need to be.  I was a little wary of the Jon Heder character, having just come off the great Napolean Dynamite buzz.  But, I found his character interesting and didn't think he had nearly enough time to flesh it out, but he did a good job with what he had.  You don't have to bust your brain trying to figure out this one, but it works when you're in the mood for a straightforward romance.  It is what it is

Sadly, the DVD does not contain the special features I had hoped for like deleted scenes or a commentary... but that doesn't detract from the movie which, I think, couldn't be more perfect. Do you already love Michael? Then buy this movie for your collection just to have.  Andie McDowell singing about Miles, Ralph and Bradley is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.

She has watched the movie several times and invited other friends over to enjoy the experience. I myself have watched the movie and must say it is enjoyable but not the best movie of this genre. Would only recommend for people who like Broadway shows and musicals. I'm glad I got this movie as a gift for her as I will now be remembered for many years to come

The Gunfight at The OK Corral and My Darling Clementine have many things in common. Both of them are among the best Westerns ever made. Both of them had stalwart casts and scripts. Both of them had great directors, Sturges for Gunfight and John Ford for Clementine. Both of them didn't exactly tell the truth about what really happened leading up to and including the famous gunfight that took place on October 22, 1881.

The Immortal Yi Soon Shin is the BEST drama I have seen ever. Korean, American, doesn't matter! This is better than anything I have ever seen on TV or in the movies. Hollywood cannot touch this one! Kim Myoung Min(Yi Soon Shin) is outstanding in this!(no wonder he won the 2005 KBS BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR IYSS)It starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional, funny, sad, and can make you angry!! The numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal!! He put his country above all else and Kim Myoung Min did a great job of portraying that!

I got this movie in a three DVD pack from a local dealer, it came along with the movies Eaten Alive and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.  I'd have to say that all three movies were worth the $15 dollars I spent on the three-pack.  The movie, Jungle Holocaust, is an adventure movie in a different spin.  I dont really consider this a horror movie, at least in the conventional sense.  The movie is exceptionally well done in the development of cinematography, the storyline is interesting and the acting and er...scenes...are engrossing (to use a phrase).  What I would really call this is an anthropological adventure to the extreme...a civilized man placed in a totally uncivilized surroundings.  Communications are not what you would get off the local street corner, worldviews are nonexistent (at least to the tribe in this film), so there is no connection except savagery.  Maybe this movie would have a greater tie with Golding's "Lord of the Flies."  A fascinating movie that brings you to the heart of a world that we, especially in first world countries like the US, have forgotten about.  I would suggest "End of the Spear" as a Christian look at examining these prehistoric people.  That film isn't a horror film, it is a Christian film, but it is (as I am a Christian) an interesting exploration of meeting such tribal people on their own territory.

the original production team returned for a sequel 7 years later
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
BACKGROUND: The 1976 cel animated real sequel to Frosty the Snowman, it is shorter than the original Frosty at half an hour format. Made 7 years after the original Frosty which was an hour long format. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr, who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well. Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (Played by Shelley Winters). While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, this time we have the voice talents of Andy Griffith. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular at the studio and had voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa in the original. Dennis Day voiced the Parson, and Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did in the original. The writer is Romeo Muller, just like the original and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. There are no original songs this time out, as Christmas standards are used instead. Oh, there is another film out there called "Frosty Returns" that is marketed as a sequel to the original Frosty, but it is made by another studio. It features the voices of Johnathon Winters and John Goodman, it's fun but not up to the quality of this show.

This is one of those groundbreaking films that that put the whammy on a genre; in this case, the Western can never come back.  Oaters traditionally are the realm of strong male characters righting wrong, loving their horses, and ignoring the school marm. Robert Altman, a political and cultural man of the 1960's Left simply says "horse feathers."  The hero is a corrupt bawdyhouse owner.  The school marm makes her living in a crude manner and normal everyday middle-class types don't really exist in the hardscrabble world of capitalism.

Lot's of skiing, women that were hot in the nineties, and a little bit of cheese combine to make this the best drama of all time for skiiers.  This movie teaches essential survival skills like exactly how to handle a French jackass ski-instructor if he ever blames you for stealing his heli-ski clients.  What you do is offer to split the tip with them, then when he says with his french accent, "I don wan to split de tip", just slam your ski locker in his face and come up with an extremly witty comment, then call him an azzhole as you walk away.....brilliant!!

Probably the Best Drama Series Ever Made
</Text>

I came across the Immortal Yi Soon Shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels. Up to this time I had never heard of it, but immediately I was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing. As I continued to watch (it had English subtitles fortunately) I became enthralled by the acting, plot and historical theme. With a little detective work, I learned that I had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes. I told my wife how good it was, and after we watched an episode together, she and I both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it. We managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television. Nearly every episode was better than 90% of the Hollywood movies out there. If you like, action, drama, amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors, intersting history, and some of the best writing I have seen on television, or anywhere for that matter, check this out

Dental hijinks
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This two-reeler begins in the middle of the night.  Stan is suffering from a toothache, and his problem is keeping Ollie up as well.  Nothing he does helps him, but predictably makes things even worse.  All of the commotion in their room brings short-tempered landlord Charley Hall storming in, and the boys have a violent altercation with him that sends him off fuming.  Since everything has tried and failed, there seems no recourse but to go to the dentist.  (The scene in the dentist's office was later remade in their first feature film, 1931's 'Pardon Us.')  Things don't look good here either, since all of the patients are being carried out on stretchers.  Stan resists going in, but is dragged there anyway.  He's terrified of having the tooth pulled, and to calm him, Ollie says he'll show him how easy it is.  Unfortunately, the dentist, who was asked to leave the room during this, tells his assistant he's done for the day and to go in and pull the tooth of the guy in the chair.  Ollie ends up being snuck up on and chloroformed, with his tooth the one that's pulled.  Ollie is so furious that he gets into a scuffle with Stan, and during this they release laughing gas from one of the tubes.  The two of them begin laughing hysterically, and soon two of the nurses are laughing as well.  (The theme of starting to laugh and then getting more and more carried away and hysterical was to be revisited in a few of their other films, such as 'Blotto.')  The boys are still laughing up a storm as they get in their car and try to drive away, causing chaos and road rage all around them, not to mention the wrath of slow-burning cop Edgar Kennedy.  This is a solid comedy all around, with not a dull or wasted moment, and a great combination of both physical and situational comedy.  It's also a fascinating look back at how dentistry was conducted in the Twenties.  Today dentists use Novacaine instead of laughing gas and chloroform, and it's no longer routine procedure to just pull teeth that are giving one a problem instead of just drilling the cavity or infected area out and putting a filling in

A Midlander's Review

<text>

Being from Midland you might say I'm a homer and thus have a bias towards this movie.  This movie was literally made at the very end of the oil boom period - in fact many of the companies' whose name appear through out the movie had gone out of business by the time it was released (that's how fast the bust hit).  Terry Jastrow (who is from Midland) and his real life wife Anne Archer are great opposite each other on the screen while Mary Kay Place provides great commentary on life in Texas Oil Business

I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since.  The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.

I originally saw this IMAX movie in Hawaii, at the Polynesian Cultural Center 3 years ago...and bought the soundtrack, always hoping to get the DVD.  Much to my amazement, the movie was included for my PC as one of the features for Windows XP.  Anyway, the music, narration, and footage is breathtaking, I left the IMAX theatre feeling physically off-balance because of the motion of the seas and the ocean, and so moved by the magic of it all that I was teary-eyed the rest of the day.  I ended up at Sunset Beach on Oahu's NOrth Shore that evening watching the sunset and had the beach to myself. It is one of those days that you will never forget in your lifetime, it is still so vivid, and watching this DVD brings every cell in me back to The Living Sea and the beaches of Hawaii.  Absolutely moving and breathtaking...even when watching on the small screen vs. the IMAX screen.  You will not be disappointed

The characters are likable, there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film, but only about half of the scenes are necessary.  It seems as if they just wanted to give Gene Wilder a few more chances to be quirky.  Gene is a funny guy, there is no doubt about that, but enough is enough!

This is one of my favorite movies ever. It really captures life in the 1800's slums and you really get attached to the characters. There are parts that you can barely watch because you feel for the characters. This is a great story about people who hit rock bottom and become much stronger people by becoming tougher and working their way up again to achieve their dreams. I've seen this movie about 3 times and each time I see it, it is just as good

I can't believe how underrated this movie is! I never saw it because I had never really heard much about it, but when I finally saw it, I absolutely loved it, along with my whole family! I'm 20 year old girl, so obviously this is my kind of movie, but my brother loved it too because the script is so clever! This movie is hilarious, touching, incredibly romantic, and so beautiful!! The cinematography is astounding, the sets and the costumes are wonderful, and Tom and Nicole are perfect together. They have such great chemistry on screen! I have watched this movie again and again and it is one of my all-time favorites. I highly recommend this film! This is an epic film that should not have been overlooked!!!

Well written, well acted, and well directed, this is much better than 99% of all films on TV or in the theatres.  the only reason it is unknown is its adult content - marijuana smoking and romantic affairs, lending amusing background to a woman's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life.  This is that rare bird, an intelligent film, for adults. My favorite line: Joe Mantegna's remark to Mia Farrow: "You're really interesting", after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible.  It is not a 5 star film, like say "Witness", but it is an excellent small film.  This is for film fans who prefer romance to violence

This version of Pride and Prejudice takes quite a few liberties with Jane Austen's most beloved story, but manages to endear itself in spite of that.  Olivier's Darcy will be a shock to those who are in love with Colin Firth or Matthew MacFadyen, but he does so well that you'll be charmed by him in no time.  And Greer Garson's Lizzy is as spirited as you could wish.  The costumes are all wrong, yes, and it is a little distracting for those of us who revel in Regency dramas, but once you get over that, and immerse yourself into the story, you'll be swept away.  Highly recommended

In 1969 an unknown Soviet filmmaker Mikhail Kalatozov dared to tell an epic and tragic story concerned with the Italian General Nobile who tried to cross the North Pole in a dirigible failing in his attempt . The awful Odyssey in the middle of this ironically polar hell when no one responded his SOS calls make of this film one of the darkest movies ever filmed.

Observant little human comedy from Milos Forman
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Here's another great film that sprung forth from the Czech New Wave: another film that, through its small gestures and subtleties makes some big statements. I'll leave it for you all to discover Forman's delightful insights into human behavior in LOVES OF A BLONDE. Suffice it to say, the plot---which involves a young girl's (Hana Brejchov attempt to find true love as a factory girl---could have become whimsical and even sentimental in other hands. In Forman's, the whole thing is grounded on earth. Instead of being a weightless romantic comedy, LOVES OF A BLONDE aims for realism, and while Forman maintains a relatively light touch on the proceedings, everything that happens to her---she finds love in a piano player, makes love to him one night, and then eventually pursues him to his home, where she meets his ever-bickering parents---still has its own kind of weight to it. The only way I can describe it is, I guess, the weight of real life. I haven't seen a more accurate recreation of a marriage that has dulled out in any other movie than I saw in the second half of LOVES OF A BLONDE, with Milda's parents: it is comic, yes, but it is also uncannily realistic, and maybe you'll recognize your own parents when you see the control-freak mother and the carefree father in this film. As for the blonde of the movie...well, she doesn't necessarily become sympathetic as the movie progresses, but we get a sense of why she begins to attach herself to the piano player Milda: she sees him as an escape from the drudgeries of factory life. Understand that, and you'll find the ending of this film poignant and maybe kinda sad. (Her dream has been shattered, but she keeps on believing it anyway, either out of hope or simply desperation.)

Friday Foster may not be Foxy Brown, but it's well worth your time if you're into this genre.  It does have a catchy little theme song!  It doesn't have alot of the action and violence of other Grier films, it's more about unravelling a conspiracy.  Jim Backus is given high billing, but only appears in one scene.  Carl Weathers is at the bottom of the billing, but appears in most of the film-But that's a good thing, coz who doesn't like Carl Weathers?  Yaphet Koto, as usual, is a joy, and actually gets a few laughs.  For those like myself who occasionally fantasize coming home from work to find a naked Pam Grier in the kitchen making goulash, will enjoy the two topless scenes.  Foster sure has no problem jumping into the sack with people in this one.  Basically all I can say about Friday Foster is that it's a sure bet if you dig Pam Grier and/or blaxploitation movies.  I know I dig

One of the best movies of all time! Bertolucci captures it all: everything is well-rounded, every intimate moment realistically captured, the scenes, the emotion, the beauty and the avant guarde. This is avant-Guarde cinema at its best, it doesn't isolate the viewer, but wholeheartedly brings them into a brave new beautiful world. Lucy is leisurely looking for her father, life and love in an isolated arts commune in Italy. You will forget where you are and how you think you should be living after seeing such free and open beauty of people and interchanging lives. Gorgeous

Seriously though, Steve should have never have died, he should also have been put in command of SG1. Can you imagine that..."Why Steve, welcome to Earth...you're welcome to live out your life, if you only feed in self defense on enemies...'kay? Oh, you're also in charge of Sg1. :P" But seriously, the Wraith make this show so awesome. From Steve to Bob to Edward, to Gordon and Alexander, to Michael and Eric (by far James's best performance yet).

Most Underrated Spielberg Movie

This is my favorite Spielberg movie. Most other directors would live off a film like this for the rest of their lives. For Spielberg, this is almost a forgotten movie. Wonderful story about a young English boy (Christian Bale) living in China who gets separated from his parents and ends up in Japanese prison camp during WWII. Filmed in China, it beautifully depicts in full detail a part of WWII that is seldom viewed.

I first saw this movie on satellite TV with my mom one winter vacation.  Recently, I was reminded of it, and remembered how wonderful it is.  Besides being an adorable story, the film is shot beautifully in black and white, which the DVD shows off perfectly.  I think it's much better than You've Got Mail, although I like that movie, too.  Definitely worth at least a rental

This film is frightening in a quiet sort of way...I enjoyed it immensely. It was an especially scary watch, considering I was living an hour away from my military base in the backwoods of the Thetford Forest, in the East of England, in the middle of the night across from a patch of said spooky forest. Delicious. The plot is solid, the special effects adequate to the story, the acting good. I like that it is so quiet, and brings a fairy-tale creature into the modern age so deftly, without the usual American Hollywood theatrics. What would a military unit do if met by a group of supernatural beasts? Hmn... this film offers a good answer. (I do so like werewolves! Check out Ginger Snaps Back -the prequel to the corny Ginger Snaps- it is also quiet. My inner 16-year-old liked it alot, as it is a bit on the young-female-empowerment side. Watch for the scene that shows just how gutsy Ginger is when faced with a jerk of a captain.

This is by far the best movie that I have seen that portrays the real life of a Gypsy. Though it is not a documentary, but you will learn a lot about the Gypsy way of life, their music, and most of all FLAMENCO in a very beautiful and touching story.

This is one of the great Westerns: strong cast in every role, straighforward plot, glorious locale, and lots of hard riding and fast shooting.  For fun, see it as the middle film in a trilogy of Viet Nam-related Westerns.  "Magnificent Seven" is first (all ideology and victory assured), "Ulzana's Raid" is third (everybody's burnt out and savage and nobody wins); "The Professionals" in the middle.  A wicked, wealthy Texan (Ralph Bellamy in the same kind of hat LBJ used to wear when he was on the ranch pretending to herd cattle) hires a small band of highly skilled, experienced professionals (think Green Berets) to rescue his wife (the Viet Namese peasants) from the wicked Jack Palance (the VC).  They do the job, but it turns out the wife really loves her "abductor" and prefers him to the Texan, so the professionals return her to her lover and her home, and, "going native," go back with them.  Or you can skip all that and just enjoy the hell out of this fabulous movie

its easy to state facts when you talk about the quality of a power tool or a tv.  but when it comes to things like movies and music, its all a mater of opinion.  my idea of a great movie might be your idea of the worst movie ever made.  so its not a good idea to buy or not buy a movie based on someones opinion of it.  i liked this movie in fact i just watched this movie 5 min before writing this.  if you are not sure if its your cup of tea rent it before buying it. i seen it 10 times over the years and i still like it

Cagney's startling performance as Tommy Powers, in William Wellman's PUBLIC ENEMY, was to be expected. He was powerful when needed. Gentle, with his short jabs of affection. And his fast-talking wit, whether in anger or in good-spirits, was in amazing contrast to his relatively slower talking co-stars. Or was it to be expected in 1931? I didn't know until watching the commentaries around this film that co-star Edward Woods was supposed to be the lead, and that Cagney was to play Matt. At the last minute, in movie minutes, the roles were switched. And yet both actors were beyond comfortable with their new parts. (Edward Woods was incredibly underrated. Does anybody know why he quit making movies in 1938? He lived for decades after that.)

A Great Beginning to a Great Series
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is the first series of Upstairs, Downstairs.  Chronicling the lives of masters and servants in a Belgravia townhouse, Updown, as it is affectionately known, covers about twentyfive years.  The first series lasts from about 1903 to 1908.  It introduces most of the main characters of the entire chronicle, barring a few later additions to the caste.  Most of this first series concerns the career of Sarah, who has the impertinence to come to the front door when she applies for the position of parlormaid in the first episode.  We also see the early stages of the career of Elizabeth Bellamy, daughter of the house, as she rebels against the path her life is expected to take by her parents.  Some of the episodes in this first series were filmed in black and white, due to a cameramen's strike.  I find these particularly effective in portraying the barrenness of life below stairs.  Some of the episodes are a bit off target, especially The Swedish Tiger, which is just plain weird, but remember the series had not yet reached classic status when these episodes were filmed.  The first series is a great way to start your acquaintance with the residents of 165 Eaton Place

A charming, clever British comedy
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted.  The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).  Still, fans of early British cinema will enjoy this film a lot

Truly Extraordinary

Thirty years later it is hard to imagine "The Story of Adele H" without the then twenty-year old Isabelle Adjani as the title character.  But at the time Truffaut's decision to cast the young French theatre star was very risky.  Not because there was any doubt about Adjani's acting, but because casting someone who was arguably the most beautiful actress in the world as a character driven mad by unrequited love raised a potential credibility issue.   Would viewers believe that the advances of a woman so beautiful, passionate, and intelligent were rejected?  And could someone like that elicit sympathy from the average viewer.

Even though Gordon Lui is the main reason you're buying this film, the story isn't bad either. Excellent training sequences and even better fighting sequences. My only complaint was a dragged out jail scene which lasts about 15 minutes. But that scene is not enough to tarnish this film. This is a solid film

I guess that is the point of this movie, but there is a little more to it.  Kowalski played by Barry Newman is a car runner that always delivers his cars.  On his drive there he gets chased by a bunch of cops but he drives a Dodge Challenger, so nobody will catch him.  His back story is explained in a few scenes of how he used to be a cop and a race car driver.  Everything in the movie is very interesting but the car chases are the thing that is going to hold your attention.  Well, also the naked woman riding the motorcycle, you have to like her too.

I really love Bones.  It has everything: suspense, drama, humor, pretty people, fun storylines.  I have yet to miss an episode, and even into Season 2 this is probably my favorite.  It adds depth to all of the characters.  Also, the winter holidays are my favorite time of year.  I like holidays that are about what is good in the world.  Bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day.  I cry through half this episode, but in a completely good way.  Buy, watch it, love it.  But watch it with a friend if you don't want to cry alone.  So moving, great performances by the whole cast.  Emily Deschanel was powerful in this one, she brings real vulnerability to Brennan here.  David Boreanaz, as always the perfect sympathetic hero, loveably old-fashioned. Cute, funny moments.  Touching, poignant moments.  This really is the best of what is great about Bones

Another great Powell/Loy collaboration this time with Loy as an heiress who's suing a newspaper for $5M after they ran a story about her being a husband stealer - she's not.  Spencer Tracy runs the paper and with nowhere else to turn he hires Powell to romance Loy and prove that she is a husband stealer...problem is Powell ain't married, so he quickly marries Tracy's girlfriend (Jean Harlow).

This movie is filled with so many different ingredients: intrigue, lessons on overcoming fears, and it helps one become stronger in believing inside what can truly make your life happy.  I've seen it a few times, and enjoy it more each time

Nobody is safe from satire, not even Alfred Hitchcock. But Mel Brooks straddles the line between parody and affectionate homage in "High Anxiety," a hysterical psychiatric comedy that deftly references all sorts of Hitch films -- while keeping in Brooks' trademark slapstick, hilarious dialogue, and weird characters.

A comedy with a bitter sweet edge, "The Purple Rose of Cario" has a fairly simple premise. Cecilia (Mia Farrow) struggles to make ends meet during the Great Depression. Her husband Monk (Danny Aiello)is a lout who cheats on her and gambles since losing his job and Cecilia has to work in a restaurant and take in laundry to meet their bills and rent. The only escape that Cecilia has is going to the movies--the fantasy world of Hollywood gives her a coccoon from the brutal real world. Her favorite movie "The Purple Rose of Cario" featuring Gil Shepard (Jeff Daniels) as Tom Baxter (also Jeff Daniels in a dual role)changes her life when the character Tom Baxter walks out of the movie into the real world. He says he's in love with her and wants her to be happy something no one else except Cecilia's sister cares about. The rest of the characters in the film (Edward Herrman,Milo O'Shea, Deboarh Rush, Zoe Caldwell, John Wood, Van Johnson)are pretty upset and end up sparing with the audience watching them on screen when they complain how boring the movie is.

This was never meant to win an Academy award. It's simply a fun, classic country filled ho-down film with the intent to showcase some of the better country artists of the sixties. The acting is below average, and I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the charm with these two "Hillbilly" films starring Ferlin Husky. It's nostalgia at it's best, and you can bet the farm-fence that I'll be watching this many times again. Forget the Mamie,and Jayne talk; they were a bonus to this classic clunker. They were never meant to steal the show. Pick up "Hillbillys in a Haunted House" too. That one will do a number on you that you're not likely to forget anytime soon

Talk to her is an unforgettable masterpiece about two female coma-patients and the men who nurse them. Provocative and colorful, Almodovar's film keeps the audience on the jump with stupefying plot-turns and as usual he makes short work of  small-minded moral ideas. His piety is seasoned with humor, the entire film a tightrope-act on the border of good taste - but afterwards you will say to yourself: thank God that I have seen it!

This is a beautiful movie, but please have no misconceptions about what you're getting into.  It is not a traditional love story.  It does not have a happy ending. You are taken on an incredible journey, and grow to love these innocent people, who burn with passion--  then you see terrible, undeserved things happen to them.

The best historical war drama from the Far East
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have seen many historical war dramas from Far East (mainly China's) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy.

See How Good A Movie Can Be?
</Text>
</title>
<text>

Since the storylines of this fourteen-year-old film must surely be well-known, let me say that The Piano, one of my favorite movies, is a unique production whose makers went out of their way to truly give it the appearance of the mid-nineteenth-century. It strolls forward with an anti-modern slowness in order to accentuate the unspoiled scenery of New Zealand, and successfully bring certain moments to prominence with a pace that matches that of the pre-electronic era in which it is set. The quality of the visuals is heightened by the performances given by Holly Hunter, Sam Neill, Harvey Keitel, and most especially Anna Paquin, whose skillful portrayal here won her an Oscar at the tender age of eleven. The plot of The Piano is highly unusual, even unique. For filmmakers to have accomplished the release of a tale concerning a woman of the 1800's, who went from Scotland to the most remote of British colonies in order to marry a stranger, for this woman to be one whose self-imposed muteness is compensated by her lovely playing of a piano...I'm daunted by the courage of those who brought The Piano into reality. For the wealth of feeling in its story, for its setting, for its cast and for its sheer brave inimitability, it is a fine motion picture

<Text>
I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.

I saw this documentary in a theater when it was first released in the 1970's. 30 years later, many of the images remained etched in my mind. I was shocked to see the living conditions of the miners and their families. I was moved by their stories of struggle and perseverance. We often forget that coal miners risk their lives every day so that we can stay warm and have light in our homes. Regardless of how you feel about unions, this movie will make an impression on you. Highly recommended

This Picture hit the theaters back in 1975 when a series of disaster films were made. Steve McQueen plays the role of Fire Chief Michael O'Hallorhan, Paul Newman plays the role of Doug Roberts and William Holden plays the role of James Duncan. Roberts is the architect that built the 138 story skyscraper in the heart of the Golden Gate City San Francisco. So James Duncan the owner of the building decides to throw a party inviting over 300 guest to celebrate it's opening. Things start to go wrong when a **** starts in a hall closet. Roberts gets more concern when he fines out that Duncan son in law Roger Simmons has cut cost by putting cheaper wire. Now it becomes Fire Chief Michael O'Hallorham to get the 300 guest out quickly without anyone getting hurt

this is the story of two navy lifers who are given an assignment of transporting an 18-year old,for a petty theft,to prison.one of the lifers feels pity for the kid and decides to show him a good time before he has to serve his 8-year sentence.the prisoner it turns out has not experienced much and the 2 show him what he's missed all within a 5-day period.jack nicholson puts in yet another great performance,while otis young and randy quaid put in credible performances.other people make appearances like carol kane as a prostitute and look for a gilda radner before her saturday night live days,in a brief apperance.this is a very good film but i wouldn't say it were great,for no particular reason other than it not being that interesting of a story nor a film that i would want to watch over and over again.it definitely is worth seeing though,at least for nicholson fans

A great introduction to Clint Eastwood and to Westerns
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Not being a fan of Westerns, I figured I would watch ten minutes of this movie and move on.  The opening scene completely sucked me in, though, and the movie took off from there.  The movie opens with Eastwood being lynched by a band of nine men who incorrectly believed he had stolen their friend's cattle.  Eastwood is left to die, only rescued by a marshal who takes him to jail, where his story is verified by the judge, and Eastwood gets a job as a marshal.  His intention, of course, is to bring the nine men tried to take his life to justice.  The action in the movie consists of Eastwood kicking some major lawbreaker butt, all while looking ruggedly handsome with a trademark glare.

I absolutely love Atlantis. From Ronon Dex, to Sheppard, and to all the faces. I'd cry if Atlantis was cancelled. Seriously though, Steve should have never have died, he should also have been put in command of SG1. Can you imagine that..."Why Steve, welcome to Earth...you're welcome to live out your life, if you only feed in self defense on enemies...'kay? Oh, you're also in charge of Sg1. :P" But seriously, the Wraith make this show so awesome. From Steve to Bob to Edward, to Gordon and Alexander, to Michael and Eric (by far James's best performance yet).

After slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we Twenty-First Century Americans were not the intended audience for this movie. The movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the National Socialist Party in Germany, which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made.

Teenage Wasteland!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There are buttered-up popcorn movies that entertain you, score a ticket to "Jurassic Park" and Spielberg for that, and there are films with gravitas, that move you, disturb you, drag you to the altar kicking and screaming, to consider circumstances you might not brave yourself.."Badlands," Terrence Malick's 1973 directorial debut, an overlooked jewel of a film, forcibly moves you, and takes an unsavory subject, the Charles Starkweather serial killings' crime spree, up in the vacated Badlands of South Dakota, and refines it til you posit, "How did we get here as a country? What went wrong?"..And then you appraise the challenges a film-maker overcomes to project the psychopathic wrath of two teenagers (Martin Sheen as Kit Carruthers, Sissy Spacek as Holly Sargis) on a thrill-killing "honeymoon", onto the silver screen and make it empathetic, palatable..Why would anyone care in the first place about two low-life, lost highway delinquents, who shoot a parent, assume they can get away consequence-free, and move on with their careless lives like nothing more infractious than cutting an afternoon civics class has occurred?..However, "Badlands" is rooted in unfortunate fact, these inexplicable events happened to a pedestrian populace in North America, and Malick lets you tag along in this teenage angst riddled odyssey, deeper and deadlier into an American wasteland..The film is palpable evil genuis, arguably a top ten American film classic, irrespective it was shot by a first time director, with an unknown cast.."Badlands" resonates with gritty authenticity, cinematic style, fierce inhumanity, and the most haunting musical score (Erik Satie's Gymnopedies 3) that underwrites a Sissy Spacek voice over narration, spoken in a lazy monotone like a detached schoolgirl explaining away her unexcused absence in the principal's office, when in fact Holly (Sissy Spacek) is the fractured other half of the Kit Carruthers' killing machine, a bossom buddy in crime..Some films are purposefully pure entertainment, escapist faire.."Badlands" on the other hand is rare art, belongs in a museum

Before the Fall

Kit and Holly are presented in this story by Terrence Malick as total innocents, living in a  prelapsarian state, completely unaware of right and wrong, good and evil, and ignorant of guilt or sin. They have minimal conception of the consequences of their actions; in effect, they appear almost totally to lack imagination or foresight, and can barely empathise with each other, let alone other people. Things just happen, as Holly sees it. Kit doesn't feel hostility to the people he kills: they are merely in his way. There is no remorse. He is only marginally conscious that the structured world outside his own will eventually catch up with him. These  kids are like Adam and Eve, with a limited knowledge of what is forbidden, but no real knowledge of the meaning of life and death. Holly throws out her sick catfish, showing no feeling. Her dog is shot as a punishment by her father, indicating he, too, is careless of death or pain. Kit stands on a dead cow, as though puzzled by its absence of life. Neither of the two seems to cry or laugh much.  In one way these characters might also be thought of as throwbacks to a prehistoric, animalistic past,  where the younger man simply eliminates the older, in order to secure a mate for himself. Just the way of nature, and beyond criticism.  Apparently, so I've read somewhere, this is the mindset of the criminal, who cannot see what he is doing wrong. He has to get by, somehow, and takes the easiest path. Why work, when you can steal?  If obstacles arise, eliminate them. People are OK, otherwise. Live now, die later. This is an extraordinary film, superbly acted

Loved this DVD because it's useful on so many levels for my Spanish class.  Can use it for cultural discussions of music, social issues, history of Cuba, current policies toward Cuba, etc.  Most expecially, kids like music and the life stories of the musicians are quite moving.  Also, for the beginning student, many of the singers' dialogs are also not too hard for them to follow

Ah Yes, the Famous Summer Graduation Trip (in Greece)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This movie is a highly enjoyable, somewhat erotic 70's era film that reflects Greek nightlife and lifestyles of adventurous, yet responsible young adults traveling abroad for a summer vacation. As Darryl Hannah's naked preview to "Splash", she can be found splashing around in clear blue Ionian waters with her boyfriend (played by handsome Peter Gallagher) and his new French, female lover who lives and works in Greece and becomes part of their existing relationship. (Yes, clearly liberal European values here, as all three of them also splash around in olive oil, champagne and the villa waterbed!)

This movie is so stupid it is funny.  I saw it when it first came out and I still haven't forgotten it nor will I ever. This is what the writers of the Groove Tube, Saturday Night Live, and Second City Television are all about.  Watch this film and see a true comedy classic.  Individual skits like "Catholic High School Girls in Trouble" could have been made into a full length movie all to itself.  It was an era where one didn't have to be politically correct.  This is what comedy is all about.  Forget the garbage we see today.  Forget Martin Lawrence or Cedric the Entertainer.  See Kentucky Fried Movie and you will see what comedy is suppose to be or what it once was.  Oh, by the way, Stephen Bishop also has a cameo role in this film and he isn't singing "On and On"

The Immortal Yi Soon Shin is the BEST drama I have seen ever. Korean, American, doesn't matter! This is better than anything I have ever seen on TV or in the movies. Hollywood cannot touch this one! Kim Myoung Min(Yi Soon Shin) is outstanding in this!(no wonder he won the 2005 KBS BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR IYSS)It starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional, funny, sad, and can make you angry!! The numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal!! He put his country above all else and Kim Myoung Min did a great job of portraying that!

Anitra Ford really only movie star performance
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The only reason I bought this movie, because it had Anitra Ford in it. Pam Grier plays the role of Blossom, Anitra Ford plays the role of Terry and Sid Haig plays the role of Djanglo. Terry is invite to go to a small tavern in town where Blossom is singing. While their Blossom and here thugs try to rob the place. Terry is taken hostage by Djanglo and thrown in a getaway car. When the local police catch up with the car Djanglo jumps over the bridge leaving Terry to fend for herself. Despite her innocents, Terry is sentence to life on a Government work farm known as the Big Bird Cage. When Blossom tries to take at the local politicians. She is also sentence to the work farm. There Blossom, Terry and Djanglo who's undercover as a Warden Guard get together one more time. How does one escape from the work farm? If you do escape, do you make out alive? I first saw Anitra Ford on the Price is Right Game Show as a model with those gorgeous long legs. As far as I'm concern Anitra does an excellent showing for herself. If you like Anitra Ford then you like this picture.

There are tons of women in prison films out there.  There are so many that often times they seem almost repetitive.  However, this film was very unique because it provided a great mix of comedy and action.  Pam Grier as  a tough revolutionary provided all the action as she ploted to free the  mistreated women from prison.  The comedy mostly came from the sexually  deprived women, who were full of one-liners and crazy notions.  But of  course the movie still contained all the things that make a good prison  explotation film....lots of nudity...violence...bad laguage and did I  mention lots of nudity. It's worth seeing!

not as great as "Charlie Parker"
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Bird, is a film about the life of jazz great Charlie "the Bird" Parker. Forest Whitaker is doing a great job as Charlie Parker and the story is generally loyal to the real life, except one is lead to believe that "Chan" was his wife (in real life, she wasn't). One negative thing I felt was that the scenes were overly dark throughout the film. I think the director wanted to create an atmosphere of reality but in my opinion he overdid it to the point of annoyance. Another critisism is for a film about Charlie Parker, his talent on improvisation, his creativity could have been, and should have been emphasized more. There is a scene where he asks a friend to write a piece that he composed just that night and the friend wants to do it in the morning but by the next morning, Charlie doesn't even remember the piece, or even the conversation that took place. This is a good example but his creativity could have been emphasized with more examples like improvisation. In real life, Charlie Parker played the same piece of music differently almost every time, with some additions here and there, givin it a new mood, new angle, new taste. This could have been shown. However, despite these minor shortcomings, I think the film is a very good one. For Charlie Parker fans, I also strongly suggest the book "Bird Lives" by Ross Russell

Having watched this DVD only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting .The tour de force of Sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed.  The highlight for me was Carol Burnett and the hilarious performance of "Everyone needs a Maid" Only Carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour.

My favourite French movie
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Of course this is not the best movie in the world, or even the best French movie. But it is entirely life-enhancing, and shows Truffaut's humanity and humane feeling. It's certainly a film to watch if you're feeling low and want to be cheered up.

The Best of Both Worlds!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I really enjoyed this movie. At first I thought that her two husbands were Vadinho the gambler and drunk, and Vadinho the loving husband.  He was bascially two different people himself.  I would have left him if I was her, though but I understand that in that time women didn't leave their husbands.  Also in that time, it was not uncommon for men to have mistresses.  After Vadinho's death, I was happy that Do lor decided to remarry, but I thought that she could've found someone more interesting than Teodoro. He's a nice guy and all, but he's just so boring.  She was used to the wildlife with Vadinho, and it was a shock to her when she married Teodoro.  I think that's why she gave into Vadinho when his soul returned.  And since she was the only one who could see him, there was no harm in having realtions with him once again, and in the future. She was happy with both of them. She was getting the best of both worlds.  I highly recommend this movie to all movie goers

A thriller for people who normally don't like thrillers
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Devotees of noir & period pieces probably will not be as pleased with this as will the rest of this, but Curtis Hanson apparently decided that putting together a coherent & well-crafted film was more important than remaining faithful to one particular genre or another.  Aside from specific historical references (Bloody Christmas, for example), it is quite easy to forget that this is set in 1950's Los Angeles.  One could regard this as a shortcoming (it is, nominally at least, supposed to be a period thriller) or as an asset (a really well-told story will trump all other details), depending on one's perspective.

OH, So So Passionate and a True Story too
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Not since "Duel in the Sun" has there been so much passion and lust on the screen. The king is so totally obsessed with one of his subject's wives that he loses everything to possess her.The king nurses his beloved back to health when she developes smallpox. The king's tenderness and loving care in these scenes are absolutely precious. When the king is dying the object of his obsession realizes that she loves him. However, it is too late for both of  them. The movie is so erotic yet there is not any graphic depiction of sex. The sets and costumes are absolutely gorgeous.

Just as great as the TV episodes
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The great thing about this "movie version" is that all the original voices of Clifford (John Ritter), Emily Elizabeth, Cleo, and T-Bone are exactly the same as the Clifford episodes on TV. Basically, it is a longer version of a regular Clifford episode but they've added a few new friends and some songs here and there. Speaking of, the songs are actually upbeat and a bit catchy.  But NOT so catchy to where I find the tunes stuck in my head for hours........unlike some other kid movies (i.e. - Thomas the Tank Engine) where they play the same droning chorus over and over and over again. This movie is a great compromise because my 2 and a 1/2 year old son LOVES it, and after watching it with him numerous times now, I still like it too.

Great deadpan delivery by Elvis!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
In 1962 Elvis was given a script that would take full advantage of his flare for comedy and "fierce" timing,...the movie was "Follow That Dream,"...and he would never see this oppurtunity again for the rest of his career.Elvis deliver's a flawless "deadpan" comedic performance that is seamless from start to finish that will remind you of a young Andy Griffith.Through the innocent eyes of Toby Kwimper,..we see a different world,..a world not so harsh and positive to the touch.In the courtroom scene that would be the climatic event of the film Elvis deliver's one of the finest speeches I have ever seen on film,...and there is not a dry eye in the house.We see through this performance that Elvis the actor needed only a suitable script and then he would keep up his end of the bargain."Follow That Dream" is a wonderful motion picture that has an endearing cast of great actors who were among the best of their time,...and it shows.This was Elvis's crowning glory,..if that he had one.A finer performance by Elvis you will not find on film,..watch him shine

Ah yes...Tarantino's first script entitled True Romance which he sold for 30,000 dollars is a genius effort of great proportion and the writing, you will notice in subsequent films and scripts,is common for him. Certain  terms will show up later on in other movies. And as for Reservoir Dogs,his  second greatest film ever,he used the money from True Romance's script to  make this ingenius mob classic complete with terms used in his other films  including one or two from True Romance

This is a great movie! Wasabi is about a police detective (played by Reno) who has to travel to Tokyo in order to sort out his past when he learns that the only woman he has ever loved has died. If you are a big fan of Jean Reno you will really enjoy this movie. It has a great combination of action and humor and is a good addition to a movie collection. I highly recommend this film if you are looking for a mixture of action and fun, especially if you are a fan of anything by Jean Reno

Wonderful satire of post-war England
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
One of the first of the great Ealing comedies, and a clear indication that their comedies would carry social and political weight as well. In this picture a run-down section of London discovers a horde of burried treasure when a bomb left over from WW II explodes accidentally, and the residents of Pimlico, London, learn that they actually are a part of Burgandy, as deeded by the King in the 1400s. This means they are a separate country right in the heart of London, and they decide to act like a separate country. Thus they conclude that the laws of England don't apply anymore - but likewise England cuts them off, and Pimlico is under siege.

An enjoyable dissection of one night in 1980's SoHo
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
A very funny and insightful examination of young adults all looking for love, happiness and meaning. The film takes place on new year's eve, 1981, and follows many different young people who somehow all eventually end up at the same party (which the hostess later wakes up to find she slept through.) Elvis Costello makes a cameo and provides a running joke in the last third. The soundtrack is great--all late 70's early 80's pop and new wave. And the one who steals the show is Dave Chappelle as the cab driver who manages to give a ride to practically every character at some point, dispensing equally silly and profound wisdom along the way, on everything from friendship and destiny to life before an afro and how to "get booty." (smiling at a girl is very important, as is avoiding talking about death--"Everyone knows they're gonna die someday, they just don't want to hear it from you.") Ben Affleck is very amusing as a clueless suitor. Oh, and Courtney Love was actually bearable. All in all, a very smart, enjoyable ride

I watched one episode of Star Trek the Next Generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some Star Trek episodes again.  Rather than watch episodes I've already seen, Enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy Star Trek episodes.

This study of the intertwined lives of the sculptor Rodin and the artist who loved him with a fatal passion is quite extraordinary. Long a student of modern art, I learned a great deal from this film that had been unknown to me before. Furthermore the film is compelling as a work of art itself, and enormously important to the on-going study of women artists.

This is a very enjoyable film in which everything, from the acting, to the music, to the costumes, is just right.

There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider.

"Breaking Away" is a true rarity: a feel-good movie that doesn't that isn't silly. Yes, there are plenty of laughs in it, but they're the result of great acting and writing, not the cheap, crude one-liners that litter so many of today's so-called "comedies." And while the movie will tug at your heartstrings, it never spills over into gooey sentimentality or empty pathos.

"You know, if anything happens to me you're in command," says Sergeant Kelly (Thomas Mitchell) to Corporal Colin Spence (Henry Fonda). They're lost in the Libyan desert with only three gallons of petrol left for their remaining armored car, almost no water and a busted compass. Sergeant Kelly started out with Corporal Spence and twelve other men on a routine patrol. Three German fighters changed things. Now there's only Sergeant Kelly, Spence and four others.

Prior to watching this, I expected something on par with "Striptease" or "Showgirls," which are films about stripping that also attempt to legitimize their titillation by tossing in dramatic subplots. Even with earnest intentions, films of this sort usually end up being clich and disappointing. Adding to my trepidation was the fact I had never heard of this film, which was released in 2000, prior to 2006. I finally took a chance on it and gladly admit that it really drew me in and convinced me to care about the characters. Like most people, these women only want to find love and something real in life, yet have lost their centers. Indeed, it is the actresses' portrayals of these characters that make each disappointment and set-back so painful to watch. Sandra Oh really moved me with her performance as Jasmine, a would-be poet who sabotages her own happiness because she has come to believe she cannot trust anyone, including herself. Her performance as a sensitive, intelligent person is the most tragic among these lives because she lacks the confidence to escape her current situation, even though she easily could. As Angel, Darryl Hannah is wonderful as a helplessly dim and hopelessly optimistic dreamer. (She also looks unbelievably fit!)  Jennifer Tilly is also very good as the out of control Jo, a woman who tries desperately to win in a man's world, but comes to realize the playing field is not level. Charlotte Ayanna is remarkable as Jessie, an eager to please na  who has not yet had her spirit crushed by the weight of the world. Come to think of it, it does all sound very clich and there really isn't much of a plot to tie it all together, just several subplots. Nonetheless, the acting is exceptional, made all the more impressive by the fact much of it is improvised. (And yes, the ladies here all smoke, which would ostensibly account for their trim appearances) I enjoyed the entire two hours and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good character study without the hindrance of a plot. The DVD is quite decent, with a very good transfer, optional subtitles and some alternate scenes. This is a bargain for the price.

i watched this film twice today, which is always what happens when a film touches me; i immediately want to watch it again. and i got to this site because i was looking for the ost, but anway, here's what i thought; the acting was perfection, the story a beautiful observation, the dancing seductive and melancholic and overall the film gave a very real potrayal of the difficult choices many women make for themselves, their consequences, and how they deal with these choices in light of both mudane everyday reality and the hyper reality of nightlife. i laughed, cried and all that stuff.  then i watched all the dvd extras. and then i watched it all again. it was well worth the guy in the video shop giving me a funny look at the checkout. any girl whose ever daydreamed about stripping (you know who you are)  should watch this film. not to change your mind, but just to have a look see. it'll give you a new empathy and sympathy for all women in the industry. and it'll make you want to work out for a tighter ass

A wonderful horror anthology
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Vincent Price leads an all-star cast in this horror film. Price appears in all three segments. In the first, he plays a man named &quot;Locke&quot; who blames the death of his wife on his daughter who's just came back after 26 years. This is great, verbal horror sort of like a throwback to &quot;Night Gallery&quot; or other dramatic anthology shows, where the horror is in the character's personality and not in the graphics. only the final minutes does the story turn into what AIP movie goers expect. The second story, as has been voted by mostly all on here, is the stand-out. Peter Lorre and Joyce Jameson team up with Vincent in a re-telling of &quot;Cask of Amontillado&quot; but re-titled &quot;The Black Cat&quot;. If you've heard or read the story, you pretty much know what's going to happen...the wine tasting scene is hilarious. The final segment offers Basil Rathbone and Vincent although Rathbone has the most action as Price's character, Valdemar, is bed-ridden. Rathbone plays an evil mesmerist who mentally tortures Valdemar's wife and keeps Valdemar in suspended animation you could say in an effort to kill him and run off with the wife! The segment ends with a memorable scene that isn't really sick...but it's not for the squeamish, either! It's one of Rathbone's finest roles, aside from Sherlock Holmes and the hilarious nut-case character in &quot;Comedy of Terrors&quot;. This film came along in 1962. At 85 minutes in length, it's short for a feature-length film...but the material and the first-rate acting by everyone make it seem even SHORTER!

Is there anyone out there (women included) who didn't develop a crush on the interminably cute Lori Loughlin after watching the 1985 film The New Kids?  Probably, but for me, it was different (yeah, that's what they all say)...Lori Loughlin looked so very much like a girl in my neighborhood, whom I also had a crush on, back when I was in my teenage years...seems to me crushes were a dime a dozen back then, as were broken hearts, but I digress (as usual).  Co-written by Stephen Gyllenhaal (father of actors Maggie and Jake) and Brian Taggert (Visiting Hours, Wanted: Dead or Alive), and directed by Sean S. Cunningham (Friday the 13th, DeepStar Six), the film features Shannon Presby ("Five Mile Creek"), Lori Loughlin (Amityville 3-D, Secret Admirer), and James Spader (Pretty in Pink, Less Than Zero, Stargate).  Also appearing is Eric Stoltz (The Wild Life, Mask, The Fly II), Eddie Jones (C.H.U.D., Invasion U.S.A.), John Philbin (The Return of the Living Dead, Point Break), Vince Grant (Timequest), Paige Lyn Price (All the Right Moves), and Tom Atkins (Halloween III: Season of the Witch, Creepshow).

</Text>

<text>

Herman Wouk's book `Winds of war' became a bestseller upon its publication, just like its sequel `War and Remembrance' a few years later. These thick books, joining the fictional and historical events during Second World War, provided the subject matter for one of the greatest achievements in the history of the TV miniseries. This 6-DVD set covers the first book, with an 18-hour series shot in 1983.

This movie rocks, man. I'm so happy that they finally produced a Stephen King script almost entirely true to the original story. More than that. It's about 99% accurate. They added some stuff like a new female character played by Julie Entwistle, that wasn't in the book, but it turned out to be integral to the enhanced ending. Normally I'm very critical of people who watch these movies without having read the books first, but this time I think I can confidently say that even non-readers should like this movie. It's a masterpiece of suspense and gore. Rent it, folks, and call him the "Night Flier.

As others have noted, Arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball "My Man Godfrey" genre. It is an effectively told, outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies.

This is a surprisingly good show. It manages to have 'a little' violence, sex, and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid, and it's still intelligent enough to be interesting, humorous and kind of addicting to an adult. A modern Nancy Drew, is Veronica Mars. I wish seasons 1 and 2 were here; I wish anything more were here and I'd get that as well. I'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest, I prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent TV to sell me in that genre so I bought VM season 3 just for kicks. I'm glad I did

I showed this to my 6th grade English class, while we were reading Miracle Worker to give them a glimpse into contemporary deaf culture. They loved it, and really learned a lot about cochlear implants. I highly recommend it for teachers who are interested in giving students a broaded understanding of deaf culture and also something that will really spark classroom debate and interest

This is a chase movie, a kind of film-noir without the black and white. Here the ordinary man is Jeff Goldblum, a guy so so unhappy with his mundane job and cheating wife that he spends his nights driving the LA streets instead of sleeping. One night he finds himself in the wrong place at the right time. He interrupts the murder of a beautiful and mysterious Michelle Pfeifer and very shortly he finds himself her unwilling accomplice as both evade her ruthless pursuers. She warns him right up front that she is &quot;one of the bad guys&quot;, but he's hooked. The chase takes them to all of the &quot;mink-lined sewers&quot; of after dark LA and lets them encounter quirky and sometimes violent characters. This movie plays like a mix of dark comedy and thriller.It has a plot twist of sorts, but does not end darkly. The cameos will be interesting to film buffs, but not to anyone else. It's Goldblum, Pfeifer, and the chase that drives this movie. And thankfully, the story - though improbable - strings tightly together and does not involve stupid car chases, explosions, or wanton killing. In fact, the violence is tame by today's standards. There's the brief nudity seen in 80's movies and occasional mild profanity. A nice film to rent. I bought it

I have loved this movie since seeing it upon its' initial theatrical release. Many sleepless nights (and views) later, I was able to begin to make some sense out what Jacob Singer was going through. As listed in the other reviews, this is not a movie for the 'casual' film-watcher, as it requires the viewers' full attention. The imagery is amazingly suggestive without being overt, and is one of my favorite elements---what you 'think' you see may sometimes be more psychologically terrifying than what you actually see...

A splendid production
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This three-part television production by the BBC, released in 1999, is one of the finest films you'll see in a while.  The acting is brilliant, especially the performance by Lindsay Duncan, the direction is extraordinary, and the plot is most unusual (if improbable).  The production is flawed only by a weak musical score.

When I watched this classic documentary, I couldn't help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here, we just wouldn't make it. What it took for Inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls, body-piercing, Hummers and rap music, underneath it all is a heritage that is raw, rich and admirable; and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up. It would be interesting to produce Nanook II and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now.

Watching it now was very enjoyable I found myself going back in time. This film is in its own right a science fiction classic.

HARRYHAUSEN'S EFFECTS STEAL THE FILM
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
In the mid-'50s, Columbia released a trio of nifty black-and-white "monster" movies:  It Came from Beneath the Sea, Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers and 20 Million Miles to Earth. Aimed squarely at the youth market, each of these films run less than an hour and a half, and are brave and spunky as they feature a human race that always survives and is better as a result of the battles with the monsters. Most importantly, each has spectacular special effects by the master, Ray Harryhausen. In the years before computer-generated graphics, monsters were either created by very sophisticated cartoons, or, in the case of Harryhausen, a technique called "stop action," in which models would be shot a frame at a time; natural movement was suggested by moving the figures slowly, frame by frame. This was time-consuming, painstaking arduous, and for non-fans, pretty cheesy.  But the cheesiness is, in a way, more than half the fun. Populated by such grade B through Z performers as Hugh Marlowe, Faith Domergue and William Hopper, these movies are a comfy as a pair of old slippers and a well-worn robe. These quick morality tales are a hoot and holler; a campy, yet and faintly embarrassing, art form that demands the clich so bad that they're good."

I really don't feel I can say enough good things about this video. My boyfriend and I do this video together and we have both been very impressed. And the best part - as I get better I can focus more acutely on the relevant muscle group and maintain the difficulty of the workout. I highly recommend this video for all levels

Forget Walter Matthau , forget Goldie Hawn - they allways good ! But the way ms. Bergman rediscover for us the story of love ... when you not 15 anymore ... she really touched my hart

I really enjoyed this movie. The characters were believable and most of the actors did an excellent job. If you're looking for something heavy this is not for you. This is a lighthearted movie that west-indian people can relate to on many levels. It is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them. I have seen this alot. All in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain. There is good music, dance and jokes cant done. Latah

Cagney's startling performance as Tommy Powers, in William Wellman's PUBLIC ENEMY, was to be expected. He was powerful when needed. Gentle, with his short jabs of affection. And his fast-talking wit, whether in anger or in good-spirits, was in amazing contrast to his relatively slower talking co-stars. Or was it to be expected in 1931? I didn't know until watching the commentaries around this film that co-star Edward Woods was supposed to be the lead, and that Cagney was to play Matt. At the last minute, in movie minutes, the roles were switched. And yet both actors were beyond comfortable with their new parts. (Edward Woods was incredibly underrated. Does anybody know why he quit making movies in 1938? He lived for decades after that.)

This Is Education At Its Best

So much is unknown about the valid attempts African-Americans made to build their own society's, during the 18th century, forward.  This story tells of how they were thwarted and destroyed for 'just trying to live in America as free, productive, people.'  My classes sat with eyes glued to the screen.  It was a horrific awakening for many of my students. They were fed the lies and propaganda throughout their educations and lives, that African-Americans were a useless species.  Well, they now know the truth.  African-Americans were very diligent in building businesses, places of worship, homes, etc., which frightened the Cacausion people of that era, so they were destroyed - and much hope with them.

Classic Walter Matthau film. I enjoyed it very much because of the easy & believeable relationship between Matthau & Hawn, the suppressed attraction between Bergman & Matthau & the sweet storyline. This film was made during a time where special effects didn't fill in for weak plots; instead the story actually makes its point.  Well done.

I really liked this film.  It's not a groundbreaking movie in any way, though.  It's about a bunch of underdog kids who aren't interested in football until a coach comes along and changes their minds.  Throughout the movie we see the kids working out and trying hard to prepare for the match against the other more talented (and unlikeable) team.   It's pretty much the same thing we've seen in the Mighty Ducks except now it's about football.

Bresson at his restrained best
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
A Man Escaped is one of those films that improves with repeat viewings. Bresson makes a strange choice in omitting the opening chapter of the memoir the film is based on which deals with the hero's curiously distant emotional response to killing a collaborator, which does throw some light on the sudden apathy and inertia that paralyses him once he is on the brink of making his much-delayed escape, but in other respects it's a perfectly contained and executed movie.

This is one of cinema's great achievements, a testament of the combination of elements (subject, visual style, photographic image, movement, sound, background music, character, montage) are perfectly blended into a unique experience.  The New Yorker print, however, is the worst copy of this film (16mm, 35mm, television screenings) I have ever seen.  This was a copy with a lack of contrast, extra noise on the track, looking like a dub.  If only there was a decent attempt to attain anything better would have begun to do the film justice.  As it is, enjoy what you're stuck with but know there's something better out there.

Firefly is imaginative exiting and heartfelt. It is simply the best sci-fi... no scratch that, The best TV I've scene scince the X Files. The acting is very good, the stoyline is compeling and by the last episode I felt like I was part of the crew. I cant believe they pulled it before they even had a chance, does that remind you of anything?. So here we are stuck with law and order svcipu and the so called reality garb when we could be watching something truly original. What happened to TV that makes us think. Dont get me wrong but, Saving lives and putting away pervs is all good but, ITS ALL THE SAME!  where is Capt Kirk, where is Moulder, where is River???  :(         Science fiction does'nt mean out of this world,  Firefly really hits home and holds a message for all of us right here in the 21st century. Watch the first episode and you'll be hooked, I was

It's flat out amazing -and utterly utterly unfair- that Mark Dacascos didn't become a huge star in 1993 when ONLY THE STRONG was released. It was released horrid reviews from leading critics (I'm looking at you Roger Ebert!!!!) and managed to amass only $2 million in domestice gross. And for reasons that fail to make sense on any level, CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE got to take in over $100 million. You must be joking.

Auspicious First Effort by Director Allen
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This film is treated something like the lost child in the canon of director Woody Allen's career.  As if he would have to apologize for this instead of, say, "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion".  What Allen attempted here in his directorial debut is groundbreaking.  This is the first example I can recall of a director telling his film in mock-documentary style, later employed by Albert Brooks and perfected by Christopher Guest.  Allen proves himself to be not only a great comic visualist but there are great verbal puns here as well.  The conceit of the film is a gas.  We're supposed to believe that Allen's Virgil Starkwell, an inept dweeb of a criminal, if not among the FBI's most wanted does cause Mr. Hoover some sleepless nights.  The gags here are rapidfire but I wouldn't spoil it for those who are uninitiated.  My favorite being,though, is Virgil orchestrating a prison break with a gun he's fashioned out of soap during a rainstorm.  All this failed effort leaves him with is a hand full of soap lather.  Also, noteworthy in the cast is the late Janet Margolin as Virgil's faithful wife.  Margolin basically plays straight woman to Allen but it's a shame this gifted actress who was so good in "David and Lisa" didn't have a more substantial film career

This movie is so stupid it is funny.  I saw it when it first came out and I still haven't forgotten it nor will I ever. This is what the writers of the Groove Tube, Saturday Night Live, and Second City Television are all about.  Watch this film and see a true comedy classic.  Individual skits like "Catholic High School Girls in Trouble" could have been made into a full length movie all to itself.  It was an era where one didn't have to be politically correct.  This is what comedy is all about.  Forget the garbage we see today.  Forget Martin Lawrence or Cedric the Entertainer.  See Kentucky Fried Movie and you will see what comedy is suppose to be or what it once was.  Oh, by the way, Stephen Bishop also has a cameo role in this film and he isn't singing "On and On"

Epic Korean Drama
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late 1500s. The career and tactics of this Admiral are still studied at the U.S. Naval Academy, and doubtless those of other nations. The screenplay is based on a couple of novels, so there is some fiction, but the life of Yi Soon Shin was well documented, so there's plenty of fact supporting the story.

There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider.

Koyaanisqatsi: The cyborgs and the rest of us.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
"Koyaanisqatsi" took seven years to make, from 1975 to 1982. There is not a narration to tell you what to think. This is an art film, in my opinion, the value is up to the viewer: Is this film meaningful? Does it have value? As a viewer I say yes. This film is a fusion of music and image. In Koyaanisqatsi there are 17 pieces of music and five movements all have relative relationship to one another. The "Grid" is a polyrhythmic piece of music. There are 11 polyrhythimic structues going on at once, and it matches with the time lapsed photography that is occuring on screen. About 350,000 feet of film was shot. There definitely was a method to this madness: after the explosion of the Grid, these polyrhythmic structures settle the audience down and the film ends the way it began: a rocket ship taking off.

On a Tributary of the Amazon

<Text>
We had the pleasure of seeing this the other night in San Francisco at the Castro Theater, in dual projection 3-D against a silver screen.  Flimsy little glasses were provided to help blend the images poppped out onto the screen by the twin projectors.  It must have cost a mint just to stage this show, but happily the event was packed with like minded Creature lovers and everyone cheered, ooeh and aahed as soon as the Brazilian diggers uncover, in a solid block of limestone, the skeletonized hand of a long dead Creature, its webbed fingers beckoning right out over the audience's heads!  It was a powerful punch to the solar plexus and a reminder that even archaeology has its thrills.

Animagic Holiday fun from Rankin/Bass
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Another stop-motion Animagic hit from the holiday entertainers, of Rankin/Bass Studios, the kings of holiday TV specials. This 1 hour show was released for the first time on April 6, 1977 on ABC television network. The storyline is very similar to "Santa Claus is Coming to Town", from the same studio - and by that I meant that part of the story explains all the traditions of Easter and how they began, such as why we eat chocolate bunnies, or why we color eggs. The show opens with a newsreel showing kids asking these questions.  Fred Astaire reprises his role as the singing mailman S.D. Kluger and gives a great voice performance but he has a bigger role this time. He has traded in his snowmobile mail truck for "the little engine that could", voiced by Robert McFadden. In the story we go back in time to the beginning of the children's Easter traditions to answer these questions, to a hidden town called "Kidville". There is a scary bear named Gadzooks who hates holidays, and he is similar to the Winter Warlock character. A rabbit named "Sunny" grows up to be the Easter Bunny and bring joy to children, making great friends and allies along the way. He is voiced by Skip Hinnant, who voiced "Pogo" in a special from another studio. He befriends a lonely young King, named Bruce, who is being controlled and bullied by his tyrannical Aunt Longtooth.

Long Tall Dexter
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Dexter Gordon is Dale Turner, an ex-patriot jazz musician living in Paris and playing nightly at the Blue Note. (His character is based loosely on Lester Young and Bud Powell, but mainly it is all Dexter.) A young Frenchman (Francois Cluzet) idolizes him and later befriends him. Dex has problems, mainly booze, and between blowing gigs seems most concerned about how to get something to drink. The cliche of the self-tortured jazz musician who's got to find something new to say on his horn every night is, of course, the main focus of the film. (That this is the ONLY way to greatness for a jazzman is the great myth for the artform. But it sells.) Dex gets homesick for New York, returns, falls into his old habits, misses the flight back to Paris, and soon dies. The movie is overly long, but Gordon is mesmerizing. Dexter speaks slowly, as if from behind a veil (Gordon was ill at the time and living in obscurity in Mexico when he agreed to do the movie); he had much input on the film, creating his own dialogue and insuring accuracy. The picture has faults, to be sure, but it's a mighty achievement nonetheless. The music, of which there is plenty, is, of course, top-notch

Haunting Nightmare
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
TRACK OF THE CAT is an obscure yet brilliant allegorical tale of a snowbound family whose distorted views on patrimony and perceived lascivious behavior, all shaped by the conniving matriarchal Beulah Bondi, come to a resounding climax after being set into motion by the perceived appearance of a mountain lion. Directed by William "Wild Bill" Wellman the word "perceived" literally describes the haunting images and ambiguous and double-edged dialogue that unfolds. Brothers Robert Mitchum and William Hopper pursue the unseen cat across treacherous snow covered mountainous terrain. Wellman filmed these scenes on location on Mount Rainier. Waiting in the cabin for their return are Tab Hunter (their younger brother), Teresa Wright (their sister), Diana Lynn (in pursuit of Hunter's love) and their parents (Philip Tonge and Bondi). Filmed in WarnerColor director Wellman had cinematographer William H. Clothier essentially film the images in a bleached out and colorless "black & white" effect where everything is shot against a white background. The exteriors of blinding white snow are counterbalanced by the interiors of the cabin whose walls and ceiling are painted bleach white. In contrast, the trees, horses, furniture and actors (all dressed in dark and/or white attire) all appear black against Clothier's white cinematic canvas. The effect is unsettling, unnerving and unforgettable if you have ever seen this film. The result is that of a nightmarish and haunting tale that eludes the viewer's sense of morality in a superficial and dreamlike world of black and white where black and white are constantly being juxtaposed redefining what is apparent just for the moment. The VHS copy is in Dolby Surround stereo

Handing Tickets Out For God
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The price on this is a bit steep, especially since the bonus materials are limited (though enjoyable). Nonetheless, I didn't regret spending the money. The Maysles brothers were such amazing and groundbreaking documentarians that anything of theirs that you can get your hands on is worth it. This film follows four very ordinary bible salesmen in the late 1960's as they ply their trade in the cold and snow of New England and then in the sunshine of Florida. The Maysles' focus in particular on one gentleman who clearly is not cut out for this work and is slowly but surely headed for the scrap pile. Despite the relative mundanity of the events, you find yourself transfixed as these men endure the high-powered mindwashing of their superiors and struggle to survive in a dying industry. Few films have ever so poignantly made the point that, though God may be good box office, no one really seems to give a damn about who buys or sells the tickets to the show

Widow In Black
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Juliette Binoche is an amazing actress.  Since her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "The English Patient" in 1996 and her nomination for "Chocolat," she's an actress whose films I seek.  "The Widow of Saint-Pierre" has a bit of irony to the title.  The opening frames show Binoche in black staring out of a window.  We then move into the flashback in which most of the film moves forward.  We learn that the "widow" is the guillotine that must be shipped by boat from France before the big execution can take place.  We see director Emir Kusturica in an acting role as the very large prisoner Neel whose rehabilitation Binoche's Madame La seeks.  We keep wondering if the black dress is saved for the prisoner.  Daniel Autereil who won a Cesar (French Oscar) for his work with director Patrice Leconte for "Ridicule" in 1996 plays the lovestruck Captain who is in charge of the execution.  Spurred on by his wild and unconditional love for his wife, he thwarts the town's sentence of death at every turn, refusing to allow his soldiers to help haul the widow ship to shore.  In the moment of ultimate irony, Neel volunteers to help bring the widow to shore, which is sure to result in his own execution.  The bloody resolution and the final shots of Binoche in black bring the story to its somber conclusion.  Patrice Leconte has a great reserve, shooting this excellent screenplay in period costume and letting the depth of his cast work its magic.  This is an incredibly tragic romance, one that works exquisitely.  Enjoy!

A charming, clever British comedy
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted.  The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).  Still, fans of early British cinema will enjoy this film a lot

I just finished watching Callie and Son. I got my copy from the Dollar Store and it has another movie (Power Passion and Murder) with Michelle Pfeiffer in it as well... It really wasn't that bad, considering the price I paid. Lindsay Wagner is actually the main character and I think she did a great job, as did most of the actors in this film. The only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to. With a bit of editing and a bit better script, it would have been a great movie! The end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying... I'd recommend it for someone to watch once, but I wouldn't pay more than I did for it. The DVD quality is really poor, the sound fades in and out, but for what it was, a bargain bin cheapy, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

I saw this movie when I was a student of Latin literature and thought it captured the spirt of Plautus's plays brilliantly.  Later, I saw a stage prodction which I liked as well.  But no one can replace Zero Mostel.  He is one of the most naturally funny men in the world.  This is vulgar and bawdy and even corny at times but it is lots of fun.  It is one of my favourite comedy movies of all time.

We rented The Lorax because I realized I hadn't seen it since 1978 on a reel-to-reel tape in my elementary school library but I loved it. Somehow 27 years later I knew a lot of words to the songs, but was struck by how much the message of the movie is relevant today. If anything, these days this movie would not be shown in a public school or on television because the FCC would investigate its subversive message of enviromentalism, critique of consumerism, and caring for others.

Live From Las Vegas is fantastic!!! The best show ive ever seen... realy and i've been to a few!!! Even thought i didnt see her live in Las Vegas. I saw her in London in the UK, she was still preformed a Unbelievable show on DVD and was just like watchin her when i did in London. By the way, Britney does sing some songs live, like 'Baby One More Time', 'Not A Girl Not Yet A Women' and 'Sometimes' and the reason why she Occasionally does not sing live is because she jumps around and dances and would be out of breathe qucikly... so for that reason she can sing live!!!

A 4  1/2 STAR REVIEW

<text>
<Text>
Darkness (for those who wonder what the title film means) is not the only time of the day TENEBRE's would-be victims should be afraid of when a psychopath starts imitating the murders of one best-selling author's latest creation.  Before you can even say what the--, this 1982 horrorfest has already delivered the goods with style and flair.  Never has it been more fun to witness the untimely premise of its cast.  With a touch of ingenuity from its director and a killer-score to boost, TENEBRE is a strong and inspiring piece of film that is a definite must-see.  Undoubtedly one of the best efforts of Dario Argento's career.-----Martin Bouche

Take a brief look at the lives of some Jewish Hungarians during WW2 in Auschwitz concentration camp. I don't think any of us can even begin to imagine the hell these people went through. Watching thousands of your friends, families and neighbors being gassed to death and then loading their lifeless bodies into crematoriums until the only thing left are their ashes you are covered in. It just goes beyond anything I can fathom. These people did what they had to do to survive just one more day in the hell they were thrown into. Would I make the same choices they had? Would it be worth living one more day, doing what they had to do? I don't know, and I do not think any one of us have the right to judge their decisions. I do know this movie does an excellent job of showing how is might of been for those poor souls

After living with this film for 15 years, it seems to me that the best description of its theme comes in the words of the character Liz (Jane Birkin), who in context is speaking of the work of her husband, the painter Frenhofer.  According to her, it concerns something "shameful--it's not the body that is shameful, not the nudity, but something else . . ."

For those of you with endless episodes of Blue's Clues on your DVR or TiVo, this movie is the perfect addition to your collection...not to mention, it's nice to have something different to play.  My nearly 2 year old hated this movie at first - she didn't like Steve - but now she will ONLY watch Steve and absolutely adores this movie.  It's got everything that the 22 minute tv show has...just in an extended version.  We are constantly signing the songs from the movie, which started actually out of the blue (no pun) by my daughter.  I didn't even realize she knew them so well without the movie playing...but at dinner one night she just started signing "hey hey - shobadee ay - beep bop bay - hey hey".

Saturday Night and Sunday Morning is very good social realist film.  Finney is fantastic as rebellious youth Arthur Seaton. Having a sexual relationship with a married woman while also having a girlfriend portrays the sexual liberation of that time.  Sex before marriage was becoming more and more common, and this film represents this change in British society.  It was a well made film for the time and even today has an appealing quality

while i recently called "ballad of cable hogue" my favorite sam peckinpah movie, this outre take on revenge is undoubtedly his best, and imho one of the best of the 1970s. for those who havent seen it, the setup is the daughter of (presumably) mexican land tycoon has been impregnated by one alfredo garcia; the angry dad offers a huge reward to whomever delivers to him the severed head of alfredo, and down on his luck bum warren oates (think a seedier version of bogart in "sierra madre") is hired by a pair of "entrepeneurs" (gig young and robert webber) to do the dirty work. the irony: alfredo is already dead in a car accident. and that is the setup for where the movie really takes off in a spin of revenge, justice, betrayals, love, &c -- all against the sight and smell of the deteriorating severed head rotting in 100 degree plus heat. oates was always an underappreciated actor, but here he gives his best performance, matched by mexican actress isela vega as his doomed girlfriend. not a movie you want to watch frequently, but it is a masterpiece.

A magical retelling of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This retelling of the SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was actually based on a script that Billy Wilder wrote before immigrating to the United States from Germany, but it was only after the success of the Disney version that a demand was created for it.  The enormously versatile Howard Hawks (quite literally the most versatile director in film history, the only director to have mastered and/or created five or six genres) took the script and turned it into one of the last great pre-WW II comedies.  The story is simple:  a group of monkish scholars living together in New York City are writing an encyclopedia.  One of them is writing about slang, but being unfamiliar with contemporary argot begins research his topic by talking to people outside his normal range of acquaintance.  He runs into gangster moll Sugarpuss O'Shea, who takes advantage of the scholars to move in with them in order to escape the police, who want to talk to her to implicate her guy Joe Lilac.  While hardly Snow White, she certainly managed to stir up their lives.

Where are the other Moto films?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is a good entry in the Mr. Moto canon, which comprises 8 films made between 1937-39. It is not my favorite, however--Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation, with excellent performances by Lionel Atwill and Joseph Schildkraut, is the best of those I've seen. However, they have been very hard to find, and I've only seen about half of them. Lorre is wonderful as the mysterious Mr. Moto, and the films are great fun and skilfully made, with a host of terrific character actors--in addition to Atwill and Schildkraut, Leon Ames, Jean Hersholt, Keye Luke, John Carradine, George Sanders, Virginia Field, Ricardo Cortez, Maxie Rosenbloom,  and many others all turn in outstanding period performances. It is a real shame that more are not being made available--I know that art houses sometimes stage special showings, and I keep hoping that someone will release all eight on DVD. PLEASE

This film has a great cast.

Russians and Yankees team up to save the world in "Meteor", one of the last gasps in the celebrity-disaster movies of the 1970s'.  (Like the "Airport" movies - you'd have a bunch of celebs tossed around for no other purpose than to have their headshots printed along a strip at the bottom of the movie poster.)

This series has just a tad too much blood for my taste... it verges on horror, here and there, which bugs me; I even like super-violent action movies just fine, but the brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing (more 'personalized' violence than killing bad guys) is not my style. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.

A film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it. The story is simple enough, and not a whole lot happens. But there's no denying it, this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way. It's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers, and that the film doesn't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience. Not one charachter is stereotyped. They are human, and they'll probably remind you of people you know. I applaud this kind of a movie, and I wish there would be more of them

I'm dumbfounded by some of the reviews this page...guess they just didn't "get" it.  This film is hilarious.  It's clever, witty and extremely entertaining.  Travolta is classic as the pathetic "gameshow-host wannabe" weather man.  The characters are so well defined and so sadly pathetic in their own ways - it's what makes the film such a classic comedy.  It's unbelievable that more people have not caught on to it.  If you liked the Big Lebowski, Orange County, the Cable Guy - any film with esoteric characterization, you will absolutely love this film.  It's a dark comedy people, get over it

louis malle's masterpiece

</title>
<text>
<Text>
emotionally shattering true-life tale (well, sorta) based on an incident in director louis malles youth wherein the school in which he (played by the very beautiful gaspard vanesse who sadly did not continue acting) was enrolled served as a haven for jewish students hiding out from the nazis. what could have been merely a suspense tale or a coming of age movie (and it IS both, and splendid examples of each) instead resonates as a meditation on survival, betrayal, and accomodating and forgiving oneself. a great film, but only for mature audiences.

A killer stalks a small community, and a high school student (Neve Campbell) who is facing the first anniversary of her mother's murder appears to be marked for death.  This is a very well-written, clever slasher film that takes great delight in poking fun at the genre of slasher films.  It's full of trivia and self-aware clich as well as some genuine thrills and a well-planned surprise at the end.  The whole cast is very good, but Matthew Lillard as an obnoxious high school boy and David Arquette as a deputy sheriff stand out.  Director Wes Craven, who is responsible for some of the slasher films (most notably the first "Nightmare on Elm Street") that inspired Kevin Williamson's inventive screenplay, does the best work of his career here

The Cruel Sea

<Text>
A very good WWII novel that in many ways is the literary bookend to the film 'Das Boot'.  Both take place in small warships which is conducive to revealing personalities and dynamic group psychology.  The reader sees the action primarily from the standpoint of Keith Lockhart, a former journalist who begins as a freshly minted volunteer reserve officer.  His character resembles the author, Nicholas Monsarrat, who was RNVR himself, served in and eventually rose to command both a corvette and frigate during the war.  Nearly uncontrollable bureaucratic forces at play as the war drags on leads to a greater impersonality as humanity seemingly loses out to weapons and toughness as they move from the 90 person crew of the corvette to the 170 of the larger, more capable frigate.

This has got to be the BEST adaptation of Jane Eyre that I have ever seen. And Samantha Morton is the reason. She is positively delightful in the title role. She has grace and beauty just perfect for the roll. One of her lines of dialogue is incorrect. She says "I am not a beauty, I am Jane Eyre". Truthfully speaking, she IS a beauty! The story flows smoothly. It's not too long nor too short. My favorite used to be the Orson Wells, Joan Fontaine version. But after seeing this British version, I had to change. You will not go wrong buying it

The Fairest One of All!

Legendary stars Billy Barty and Diana Rigg bring one of the world's most beloved fairy tales to life in the Cannon Movie Tale, "Snow White." Starring beautiful and charming Sarah Patterson (The Company of Wolves) in the title role as the princess who fled her wicked, jealous, and murderous stepmother's castle as a child, "Snow White" tells the tale of how the princess is taken in by seven kindly dwarfs living in a cottage in the forest. As the dwarfs go off to dig in their mines each day, Snow White cooks and keeps house for years, growing into a sweet and lovely young woman. But, as Snow White grows ever more beautiful, the evil queen grows ever more jealous. Consulting her magic mirror and book of spells for ways to terminate Snow White, the dwarfs must repeatedly undo her vicious magic. It seems the final spell is beyond even the dwarfs abilities to break though. Their only hope lies in a young prince who is returning home from a long journey still seeking a great discovery to satisfy the longing in his heart.

I had forgotten how awesome this movie is- even for a grown-up, like me. It could do without all the songs (it was made before Disney wisely decided to ditch all the cheesy singing,) but it's brisk, double-layered humor more than makes up for it. Kids will think the gags are sufficiently silly. Adults will pick up on the nearly-sarcastic, nearly risque dialog, so rare in Disney animated movies. Plus, Big Foot dancing to 'Stayin' Alive' is just freaking hilarious.

Great shows about Binky taking up cycling and learning to challenge himself. There's a cycling champion, Vance Legstrong, who inspires him to succeed (wonder who that character is modeled after). 'Operation DW' is about DW having surgery to get tubes put in her ears. Some really funny stuff in this one but that's pretty much par for the course with the DW based episodes

La Haine is basically a day in the lives of three guys from ghettos on the outskirts of Paris.  After an apparently race-motivated police beating/murder, the ghettos are rife with looters, rioters, and many bigoted and intrusive police(or pigs, as the characters fondly refer to them), suspicious of anyone not caucasian or under 30.  In its most reductive form, it's about a flawed society whose seams are bursting under the pressures of ignorance, intolerance, and various -isms.  In the movie itself, this tends to remain below the surface of the characters' existences, but for in a few moments (namely encounters with police and skinheads) and brought to the forefront with a bathroom scat anecdote and repeated reference to a (very bitter) joke involving society, man, and rabbit jumping off a building (the movie is frequently funny).  Although it takes place in France, where these issues are perhaps less closeted (what with Le Pen getting 15 percent of the vote...), any close examination of pretty much every "modern, 1st world" nation  will reveal just how ingrained these problems are in the present state of the world

Nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the Cheech and Chong movies (with the exception of The Coriscan Brothers).  Aside from realizing I shouldn't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days, I realized how well done they are.  Most amazing to me was that they  held up one after the other, feeling not repetitive, though each of them is rather episodic. Most impressive was Chong's direction; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct; clearly, he took this role quite seriously.  The movies, of course, are not serious.  I rarely laugh out loud in movies these days, but I did at least a half dozen times in each of these.  The characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver, but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable, and the films all he more watchable.

One of Fisher's finest finally on DVD (see below)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Being released as part of a two disc, dual layered dual sided Hammer Horror set from Universal in September, "Curse of the Werewolf" features a fine performance from a very young Oliver Reed. You'll need to use the ASIN below or the webpage to find it as it isn't listed (at present) under its own title but under "Phantom of the Opera". Set in Spain (although Guy Evans source novel is set in France) Reed Plays Leon who's mother died during child birth and whose father raped the girl. Born in Christmas Day, it's clear that Leon is cursed; the baptism water boils which is not a good sign to say the least. The boy is adopted by Don Alfredo Corledo (Clifford Evans). Early on it's clear things are amiss as livestock are routinely killed whenever the moon is full.

&quot;THE&quot; Werewolf film
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This 1960 effort by famed Hammer Productions of London, England is one of their finest efforts, and the greatest werewolf film ever made.  Even by today's standards, the make-up for the werewolf is eye-opening and well  worth the wait to see.  The movie is filled with underlying themes and for  those who look, it may be filled with a number of messages that are not  readily apparent from the otherwise simple narrative.  Color photography,  normally a strong suit in Hammer Films anyway, is among their very best.  The performance by the young Oliver Reed as the werewolf is filled with  energy and passion.  A highlight of Director Terence Fisher's accomplished  career.  If you only can have one werewolf film, this is the one

Theatrical Soft Core Porn
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
In the late 80's to early 90's, Mickey Rourke may as well have been a porn star. Hell, every movie Rourke was in he was playing the same character who got a different hot chick...They were big-screen soft core porn films. Problem is, Mickey Rourke is so good at playing these characters that the movies he's done aren't that bad. Here, Rourke plays Wheeler...Who won't really enter into the synopsis for a moment. Rourke's ex-wife Carre Otis plays Emily, a young International lawyer who recieves a job with a big firm in New York and is hastily sent to Rio De Janeiro. In Rio, with her boss Claudia (Jaqueline Bisset) away; Emily begins to come into contact with sex almost everywhere she goes. Then, she meets Wheeler. Wheeler is that odd, soft-spoken, rich, womanizer guy every guy wishes they could be. Wheeler is the guy who says stuff to women in movies that we would never be able to get away with, but onscreen it just looks so damned easy. Anyway, unlike "9 1/2 Weeks", Wheeler and Emily don't just begin having sex. In fact, the big sex payoff isn't until the final minutes of the movie. And let's face it, if you rent this movie...You're not renting it for the story. Truth is, the story's not even that intriguing or event good for that matter. The whole movie has a plot like a soft-core porn movie. Thing is, Otis and Rourke have enough charisma on screen to pull of a movie like this. So, even if you ignore the sex, the movie isn't that bad. I, personally, think it's better than 9 1/2 Weeks. Fact is, even if you don't give a damn about the story. Carre Otis is f**king hot, so check it out.

The Mother
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is a good alternative to the bombard of Hollywood films. It potrays beutifully and naturally the meaning of love and the loneliness of the elderly. I live in one of the Asian countries where the famili members still have strong emotional bound to one another. Watching this film, I came to realize how lonely one's life can be when one grows old in the so called modern countries. Because things are so modernized, things have got so mechanical, human relation is no exception. This happens to the mother in this film. It is so touchy to see when the mother and the father come to visit her son's family, everybody is so busy with his/her business, everybody is in a rush and in the end the two of them have to stay in a quiet house with nobody around. Their visit is not strong enough to hold people from minding his/her business.

Mom's Not Too Old nor Dead, and Not About to Pack It In
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
With the death of her infirmed husband, May, an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as invisible, dead from the neck down, and unwelcome in the pseudo- sophisticated yuppie homes of her son, Bobby and his shallow wife, Helen, and Paula, a self- absorbed, clinging, and minimally talented daughter. The central family is anything but warm, supportive, and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband. The Mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies, the elder parent is both unwelcome and a burden to grown children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else.

This is an excellent hour. I did not always like the spice girls, I fell in love with them when I read real life, real spice, their book; and found out they were real people. since then I have been really trying hard to get  to know them, which is real hard in the U.S.A. This hour of girl power  documents their early years, it includes full length vesions of  &quot;wannabe, mama, say you'll be there, 2 become 1, who do you think you  are&quot; also preformances in London,Tours in Hong Kong, New York,L.A. and  at the Brit awards. This video will help you catch up, with the best female  band of all time. The video also includes exclusive behind the scene  footage. It's the closest you can get to the spice girls without meeting  them.  Rock on Spice girls

Fosse=Genius....
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is one of my all time favorite films.  Fosse only made 5 feature films in his career (Sweet Charity, Cabaret, Lenny, this one, and Star 80), but everyone is a masterpiece.  This is his best film.  It's an autobiographical film about a filmmaker/choreographer who's addicted to work, booze, pills, sex, work, booze, more pills, etc., etc..  It's definitely based of Fosse himself, and it's a rather painful portrait.  Fosse should be commended for admitting (for lack of a better term) that's he's not a great person.  There's no "closure" scenes here, where Joe Gideon (wonderfully played by Roy Scheider, Fosse's alter ego) realises the error of his ways, and makes peace with everyone.  Fosse shows warts and more warts, but in spite of that, the film is amazing.  Brilliantly edited, shot, acted, and choreographed, this is Fosse's best film, one that really defined him as an artist.  Fosse was not a prolific filmmaker, but when he did make a film, it was a masterpiece.  And this is his greatest one...

My first viewing of the campy film Secretary could not have been more ironic because I had been working as a secretary -- ahem, assistant -- for a solo practitioner for only two months. I recall leaving the theater feeling empowered despite knowing that the next day I would have to fetch whatever my boss wanted, when he wanted it. There are bosses, not just the lawyers, who long for the old-fashioned secretary.

A Top War Film
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The legendary Howard Hawks directed this WWII classic about the Mary Ann, a B-17 bomber lead by Captain John Ridgely and featuring crew members Gig Young, Harey Carey, Arthur Kennedy, Charles Drake, George Tobias, Ray Montgomery, and John Garfield.  On a routine mission to Hawaii, the crew arrives just hours after the Pearl Harbor attack and find themselves thrust into war.  Other stops include Wake Island and the Philippines. Of course, one of the purposes of this film was to rally the American spirit, and it features some of the anti-Japanese dialogue you'd have to expect.  But the film succeeds beyond the propaganda value.  The action sequences are well filmed and exciting, with terrific aerial action and some good ground sequences, too.  The camraderie amongst the crew is credible.  Each member has his own small "back story" as you would expect, but these fine character actors make it all very believable (Harry Carey is a particular standout).  This film is a true WWII classic

Here Comes Mr. Jordan is a delightful 1941 fantasy film that would later be remade with Warren Beatty (although not nearly as good) as Heaven Can Wait. Robert Montgomery, father of Elizabeth Montgomery of Bewitched fame, plays boxer Joe Pendleton, who is on the verge of fighting for the title. Joe is plucked out of his airplane just before it crashes by an inexperienced angel played by Edward Everett Horton who wanted to save him the pain of the crash. The Angel's Boss Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains) finds out that Joe isn't supposed to die for another 50 years and orders the over-eager Angel 7013 to put Joe back in his body. Unfortunately, Joe's body has been cremated by his boxing manager.

I love this movie. Maybe it's because it seemed so risque as a kid, or maybe it's because Jane hates it. Whatever, it's great fun. Sure the script leaves much to be desired. And yea, the special effects suck. It was 1968, what do you want? But that only adds to its charm. It's a funny movie, more on the silly side. This is true camp and if you like campy flicks, this one has to be in your collection

I really love Bones.  It has everything: suspense, drama, humor, pretty people, fun storylines.  I have yet to miss an episode, and even into Season 2 this is probably my favorite.  It adds depth to all of the characters.  Also, the winter holidays are my favorite time of year.  I like holidays that are about what is good in the world.  Bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day.  I cry through half this episode, but in a completely good way.  Buy, watch it, love it.  But watch it with a friend if you don't want to cry alone.  So moving, great performances by the whole cast.  Emily Deschanel was powerful in this one, she brings real vulnerability to Brennan here.  David Boreanaz, as always the perfect sympathetic hero, loveably old-fashioned. Cute, funny moments.  Touching, poignant moments.  This really is the best of what is great about Bones

Funny that someone would produce a "chick flick" based on the relationship of Novalyne Price to author Robert E. Howard, creator of the sci-fi/fantasy character Conan. No doubt someone in Hollywood thought the irony of filming a romantic character study of the man who wrote the classic male-oriented action-thriller stories of the 1930s would be a good way to attract an unlikely mix of female romance fans and fans of the Conan books and comics.

the pang of lost chances and the breakup of friendships made during shared experiences...whether it be high school, college, or any specific period of life.

As other reviewers have noted, the soundtrack is especially masterful (the use of Pat Metheny during the wedding sequence is a particular favorite

It started with the typical intro and ended with the credits. Some individuals did not get a complete download so i included my experience with the Unbox download.  i hope the review was helpful. ty

Nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the Cheech and Chong movies (with the exception of The Coriscan Brothers).  Aside from realizing I shouldn't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days, I realized how well done they are.  Most amazing to me was that they  held up one after the other, feeling not repetitive, though each of them is rather episodic. Most impressive was Chong's direction; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct; clearly, he took this role quite seriously.  The movies, of course, are not serious.  I rarely laugh out loud in movies these days, but I did at least a half dozen times in each of these.  The characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver, but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable, and the films all he more watchable.

Widow In Black
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Juliette Binoche is an amazing actress.  Since her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "The English Patient" in 1996 and her nomination for "Chocolat," she's an actress whose films I seek.  "The Widow of Saint-Pierre" has a bit of irony to the title.  The opening frames show Binoche in black staring out of a window.  We then move into the flashback in which most of the film moves forward.  We learn that the "widow" is the guillotine that must be shipped by boat from France before the big execution can take place.  We see director Emir Kusturica in an acting role as the very large prisoner Neel whose rehabilitation Binoche's Madame La seeks.  We keep wondering if the black dress is saved for the prisoner.  Daniel Autereil who won a Cesar (French Oscar) for his work with director Patrice Leconte for "Ridicule" in 1996 plays the lovestruck Captain who is in charge of the execution.  Spurred on by his wild and unconditional love for his wife, he thwarts the town's sentence of death at every turn, refusing to allow his soldiers to help haul the widow ship to shore.  In the moment of ultimate irony, Neel volunteers to help bring the widow to shore, which is sure to result in his own execution.  The bloody resolution and the final shots of Binoche in black bring the story to its somber conclusion.  Patrice Leconte has a great reserve, shooting this excellent screenplay in period costume and letting the depth of his cast work its magic.  This is an incredibly tragic romance, one that works exquisitely.  Enjoy!

A Decent Film In Storytelling: Worth A Look!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
"To Live," does not hold the same appeal for me as it once did in the past. However, I do recommend viewers to at least take a look at this film. The films narrative deals with the lives of Fugui and Jiazhen, a husband and wife with two children, as well as Fugui's mother. The time period is from the 1940s up to the 1980s. Because Fugui has a gambling problem the family loses everything: house and possessions, which splits the family apart. It is a time when the Chinese Nationalist's and Communist's are battling for control of China. Further, the film deals with the social upheaval that is afffecting the lives of many Chinese. Although the film never criticizes the changes incurred by Mao Tse Tung, just the view of the how people's lives were affected accomplishes this task very well.

Another Reason Why the Seventies Were So Great
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
"The Last Picture Show" is a film of great artistry without being artsy.  Director Peter Bogdanovich imbues the film with deep texture but there is a context for this.  In other words, this is a film with great style and substance.  I don't know if the studios would bankroll such a film today.  It's not a film that can easily be described but once you experience it you'll be forever haunted by it.  Some would say the film is a litany of disparate vignettes but these episodes when taken as a whole cohere.  What is amazing is that there are many characters here but all are allowed to develope.  It would be fruitless to cite any over the other because it is a true ensemble effort.  What's interesting is that Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman won Oscars for their work here.  In both cases these are not showy performances but works of great understatement and subtlety.  Though not unworthy of such accolades, I'm amazed that the Academy would recognize these performances because they don't detract from any others in the film

Comparisons to the 1937 classic are inevitable. Story-wise, there is little difference except for the colonization of the remake. Many of the frames are carbon copies of each other. This reviewer feels that the b&amp;w format of the original added to the suspense. The original cast is clearly superior especially the male leads of Ronald Coleman, David Niven and C. Aubrey Smith. Also, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. outshines James Mason as Rupert of Hentzau, the main bad guy. (I wonder if a stunt man performed that high dive.) A nice gesture is the cameo role of Lewis Stone,  the star of the 1922 SILENT version. It is the 1952 female leads who compare most favorably: Deborah Kerr comes very close to equaling Madeleine Carroll as the lovely Queen Flavia, with her strong (!) sense of duty. And Jane Greer probably surpasses Mary Astor's 1937 role. Both Mary and Jane are key to the plot. Watch them closely! Blessedly, despite the many frame similarities, the remake does not carbon copy the 1937 fadeout, with Ronald Coleman's gallant wave of farewell. On its' own merits, the 1952 version is a very credible adventure story indeed. It only suffers from comparison to an original classic it cannot possibly surpass

This has got to be the funniest, most warped show on cable today.  It's the ultimate show about nothing - a group of morally-deficient 20-somethings who own an Irish pub in Philadelphia.  They care about nothing but outdoing each other for attention and money.  They constantly argue over the dumbest things and come from families more dysfunctional than anyone can imagine.

"Grave Of The Fireflies" was one of the hardest-watching movies I've ever seen, and one I wouldn't have missed for the world.  Taking place in Japan during the latter parts of World War II (though it could be any country in any war), it's the story of two children, Seita and Setsuko, who are left on their own when their mother dies in the destruction of a small town, and are left to attempt to survive on their own.  Seita, the brother, is the older of the two and it falls to him to guard and care for his sister Setsuko, who's little more than a toddler.  The two  hold out hope that their father, a member of the Japanese navy, will eventually return for them.  Seita and Setsuko are wonderful and captivating characters who seem uncannily real, making their plight all the more terrifying and heartbreaking.

This is the type of story that scares me: where seemingly innocuous decisions propel characters toward a devastating fate.  The characters, portrayed by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, are going to be friends for life even if they slowly, eventually drift apart.  For a final trip together they decide not to go the safe, routine route of going to Hawaii, again, and want something different, perhaps a little adventurous, so they decide on Thailand.  While there they meet a charismatic, only slightly mysterious man on their trip and are both immediately enamored with him; and the jealousy starts to seep in.  In the midst of this subtle, female power struggle they are both conned and subsequently accused of smuggling narcotics and sent to jail. One poor decision after another and they are spinning helplessly down the drain.  It's always the more realistic tales of decent people caught up and tossed about by circumstance that are more frightening to me than the Hollywood horror-fests with aliens and gore.  There are many intense scenes throughout this film that had me caring about the principle actors and how were they ever going to get out of this horrible and unfair situation.  Claire Danes deserves top billing as she plays an average girl trapped in an unthinkable scenario, whereas everyone watching can relate to her emotional state at any given time.  She is truly a talent.  Kate Beckinsale nearly reaches the same level of intensity playing the all-American daddy's girl caught up in the chaos.  For that matter, when the two leads are playing off one another the chemistry is equally excellent.  Bill Pullman makes his presence felt with a conscience-stricken, kind-hearted turn as their lawyer.  There are even a handful of supporting characters that are memorable which makes this a veritable feast of character actors.  This is a movie worth watching over and again, and it is easy to recommend

Moving tribute to the real cowboys.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is not a shoot-em-up Western. If that is what you are after, stop reading right here. What this is, is a real heartfelt tribute to the cowboy. The genuine article cowboy. In particular, it charts a group of cowboys through the decline of the golden age of the cowboy, near the end of the 19th Century. Almost the whole of the first half of the movie, there is no plot to speak of, just character exposition building up the picture of the life and character that these men had. Nothing is rushed, and yet it is never dull, thanks to an intelligent script. There are humorous moments and great lines, but plenty of pathos and melancholy too, as the characters all deal with the end of an era in their own ways. We see the cowboy-turned-outlaw, the cowboy-turned-storekeeper, the cowboy-turned-floor sweeper... but most of all we see the cowboy turned into legend. As the plot kicks in, there is nothing contrived about it, but it all feeds into the central idea of examining what men do when their purpose is taken away from them.

A superb episode of James Garner's classic 50s TV series.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
If someone asked me to choose one episode of &quot;Maverick&quot; that superbly illustrates my favorite television series' strengths, this might be it.  James Garner's fascinatingly complex character Bret Maverick is on  full display and Diane Brewster as Samantha Crawford, Maverick's primary  female nemesis, is introduced in this episode in all her slipperiness and  duplicity in a plot that revolves around a New Orleans riverboat gambling  contest that hinges on an obscure poker rule of the day. The principals  later segue by stagecoach to a western town with a crooked casino, where  they encounter Leo Gordon as Mike McComb, Maverick's strapping Irish ally.   Jodie Foster's character in the recent Mel Gibson movie version was based  on Samantha, and Ms. Brewster's performance is a revelation, forcing the  viewer to bemoan the policy of that period preventing most television  actors from moving into theatricals.  Warners' unsung but mesmerizing  stable of character actors are peppered throughout the show to good effect,  as is always the case with this series, and this episode has a classic  feel, with lustrous lighting and photography and fascinatingly nuanced  performances.  This is one to watch repeatedly and serves as a superior  companion to the movie version

We all love George Lucas for creating the Star Wars Universe and introducing us to some of the best characters in movie history but lets face reality here, the man cannot write dialogue to save his life.  In the OT it wasn't as noticeable because the plot was not very complicated and the scenes were very straightforward, the foundation was already there.  The PT has to lay that foundation which George Lucas fails at.

'The Curse of the Grebes' is sort of a tribute to the Red Sox return to World Series glory with cameos by Damon, Timlin and Renteria. Timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by Emily Dickinson with remarkable aplomb. 'Arthur Changes Gears' is also great, he gets a bike he's been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he's so worried about getting it dirty that he won't ride it

I thought it was a great movie. Truely hilarious too. Of course, it does teach a sort of lesson about surviving in the world. But I never found it until now. This is a very cute movie and I really think anyone can enjoy it

One of the Best Horror Films Ever Made
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Boasting three shuddery tales ranging from gorgeous Michelle Mercier's steamy telephone love triangle, to Boris Karloff in top form as an eerie Russian vampire, to a sublimely creepy drop of water, this is one of the scariest horror films ever made. The great Mario Bava outdid himself with this superbly atmospheric 1963 film, which was recut, rescored, and dubbed by AIP in such a way that the film as a whole, and "The Telephone" segment in particular, was drastically altered from the original version presented here. It's a pleasure to finally enjoy this film as Bava intended it to be seen. This DVD version has only the original Italian soundtrack with English subtitles, which is a shame since some of the actors are clearly speaking English on screen. A dubbed English soundtrack would have been a anice extra, along with Les Baxter's excellent US musical score, but even so, what's here is worth every penny. The extra scenes of Karloff in the studio are a treat, and once seen, the restless corpse from "The Drop of Water" is never forgotten. I have left this review deliberately vague on plot points so as not to spoil the movie for those who have not yet seen it, but suffice to say that Black Sabbath is a masterwork that belongs in every horror fan's collection

I purchased this dvd for my very passionate son's 11th birthday.  When he opened it his eyes filled with tears.  He has loved gorillas, chimps, and all primates since he was very young.  I watched the movie before and was a little concerned about his reaction to Digit's murder.  It was as I expected, he cried in my arms.  His dream is to grow up and move to Africa to help in the survival of this extraordinary species.  The movie was given to him for encouragment from Ms. Fossey with all her beliefs and struggles.  We as the human race have a responsibility for all species on Earth.  This movie will open your eyes and make you realize how vain and selfish humans can be and it also shows that one person can make a difference and is still making a difference years after her death.

This is a neat little movie about a 12-year-old boy (Anton Glanzelius) who tries to make sense of his mother's terminal illness, death in general, and a world full of change. He tries to cheer his mother up as best he can, but she is too far gone to really notice or care. His fondest memories are times spent at the beach with her when she was healthier and their times together were better. As a coming-of-age movie, sex plays an important (and confusing) part for the boy, from the old bedridden man in the upstairs apartment who likes him to read the lingerie ads to him, to the tomboy who is the best soccer player on his team and keeps trying to show him her breasts. The movie is full of wonderful, insightful touches. Glanzelius is marvelous. A real gem of a movie

Watching Paint Dry
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Can watching paint dry be riveting, interesting, and compelling? Can looking at a beautiful woman who is naked for almost three of four hours long movie be not erotic? Is it possible to watch the movie where an Artist creates sketch after sketch of his model in preparation for a painting and many scenes run in real time and not become bored but instead be totally absorbed by the painter on the screen and how he was progressing with his work? Jacques Rivette's "Le Belle Noiseuse" is certainly not for every taste but I found it immensely rewarding. It is one of very few films where creative process with all its tension, uncertainty, selfishness and self-centering of an artist who once he began working is nearly oblivious not only to his model's discomfort but to the feelings of the ones close to him have been shown on the screen with such truthful passion, technical excellence, and tremendous acting. Michel Piccoli as an aging painter Edouard Frenhofer, once famous and productive, Jane Birkin (Liz)- his much younger wife and a former favorite model, and Emmanuelle B t as Marianne, the young, bright, and intensely intelligent woman whose presence awakened Frenhofer from semi-lethargy and made him want to paint again were unforgettable.

I was never a Richard Burton fan until I discovered this movie.Richard Burton's acting in this movie is top notch.Burton is able to pull you into his character of British agent Alec Leamas and make it all believable.Thankfully the movie is in black and white,because it adds to the overall suspense and mood of the film.The dvd transfer and digital 5.1 sound are excellent.It's hard to believe a movie from 1965 with no fancy gadgets or special computer effect's could be so entertaining,but it is.The question is will Alec come in from the cold or does he have one more mission in him

ALL ABOUT EVE -THE "BEHIND THE SCENES" SHOW BIZ CLASSIC!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
From the moment she glimpses her idol on Broadway, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) strives relentlessly to upstage Margo Channing (Bette Davis).  Cunningly, Eve steals Margo's role, smashes Margo's best friend, Karen Richards' (Celeste Holm) marriage, and becomes the toast of Broadway!  Great performances all around with some of the juiciest, wittiest, and oh so quotable ("Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night") dialogue ever!  I don't know if the film would have worked as well without the suave and sophisticated performance by George Sanders (Rebecca (1939), he is truly remarkable as the story's narrator and Broadway critic, Addison DeWitt.  This film also marks the screen debut of legendary beauty, Marilyn Monroe, who plays a bit part as Addison's lovely date at Bill's welcome home party.  Even here Marilyn's astonishing screen presence and simmering sensuality (of which she would later ride to fame on) is clearly evident.

I have to admit that good writing or not this is one of my favorite escape movies and I wish it would come out in DVD.  My liking it has something to do with John's use of the typewriter and his ability to change the  direction of the characters through the machine.  Once he damages the  typewriter he needs to make a technical sevice call to get it going again.   You can't beat that.  We even get to see a perplexed Robert Wagner and the  rest of a great cast

Masterful, A Work of Dedication and Devotion!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Masterful, simply masterful.  There is no other word that can adequately convey the quality of this movie.  Every time I notice it on cable, I immediately stop whatever I am doing and follow it to conclusion.  I can think of no other Shakespearean film that echoes it except possibly, "The Tragedy of Julius Caesar" (Marlon Brando as Marc Anthony).  A commanding performance by Kenneth Branaugh, who should be knighted as a peer of the realm in my opinion, before another title is handed over to a Rolling Stone.  This film is the sole reason I still have VHS.  If anyone enjoyed this movie, I highly recommend the Brando version of Julius Caesar and Henry the Fifth 1989 - Kenneth Branaugh and see if you notice a young Christian Bale - the boy who would be Batman.  I have had many lively discussions with respected elders regarding the better Shakespearean actor - Olivier or Branaugh.  My money's on Branaugh

Being a fan of the better CG and graphics of Sci-Fi such as Star Trek (the newer ones)  I was greatly surpised at how good the V series was.  V: The Final Battle is the second installment of the saga, so make sure to buy V: The Miniseries first.  The storyline is good, and characters are likeable and three-dimensional.  I highly recommend it for any Sci-Fi fan.  For old hands it is a fun movie, and for newcomers to both the series and the genre it is a good introduction

Wild Orchid.  Most people think its some smut movie with no plot.  No one ever looks between the lines.  It may have sex, and some crazy acting, and even a bogus plot, but the theme of it is important.  True love.  Call me sentimental and a hopeless romantic, but this movie touched me.  Emily and Wheeler, opposites in every way, somehow find love, together.  I wish everyone was as lucky.  To find happiness where you least expect it.  I wish I could be as happy as those two.  Look around you.  Do you see people with this kind of passion and love?  It's sad, too, because we know what happened to the actors who played these lovers.  I hope that someone out there has a relationship like this so that we have more to cling to then fiction.  It may not have been the best movie, but it had an important message:  When you find true love grab it with both hands and never let go.

Entertaining To A Point
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have owned Wild Orchid for quite a few years and from the beginning thought it was a bit out there. Some of it doesn't fit, some of it doesn't make sense and some of it is just plain dumb. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I like Mickey Rourke. Even though he does look at bit beat up in this movie and kind of scary looking at first with the slicked down hair he is practically oozing sex. Carre Otis's character, Emily, seems a bit aloof and childlike. She is bombarded by scenes of people having sex in an abandoned building, watching 2 people have sex in a limo. Wheeler (Mickey Rourke) almost seems to enjoy watching Emily squirm a bit. Wheeler is sort of detached, but wanting someone he can trust. Its tough to make sense of this movie because honestly the best part is the end. Now I have the unrated version so it shows more than the R-rating (for a movie like this one - unrated or NC-17 is the way to go)-the part where Wheeler and Emily make love finally. It is very arousing to say the least. I must give it to Zalman King. He knows how far to go to where the movie gets into your mind, but yet he doesn't go for the gratuitous sex. I suggest Delta of Venus, which is another Zalman King experience

This is a real rarity--a cinematic adaptation of a literary work that is just as good as the original novella from which the film came. Filmmaker Gary Walkow (he co-wrote the screenplay, executive produced, and directed the film) has created a real gem in this brilliant translation of the best known short work by Dostoevsky into film.

Amusing, Clever, A Bit Sad
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I much prefer irony to tragedy, and after Blue I was not sure what to look forward to with White. I wound up liking White a lot. Movies about "the human condition" are, for me, almost invariably obvious. While this movie does quite a bit of exploring about how a man reacts to love and the withdrawing of love, impotence and the power of performance, revenge and a circling back to love, I thought it was handled with such off-hand, dead-pan humor as to be a very sweet film. In a way, it struck me as an amuse-bouche, one of those unexpected treats that a first-rate chef will surprise a good customer with at the start of a meal or sometimes in between courses. The movie has that quality of freshness and unexpectedness.

Probably the Best Drama Series Ever Made
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I came across the Immortal Yi Soon Shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels. Up to this time I had never heard of it, but immediately I was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing. As I continued to watch (it had English subtitles fortunately) I became enthralled by the acting, plot and historical theme. With a little detective work, I learned that I had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes. I told my wife how good it was, and after we watched an episode together, she and I both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it. We managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television. Nearly every episode was better than 90% of the Hollywood movies out there. If you like, action, drama, amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors, intersting history, and some of the best writing I have seen on television, or anywhere for that matter, check this out

Goodman is The Babe
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I enjoyed this movie. Some of the reviewers don't understand this was not a documentary on the Bambino. This was a movie. The fine gentlemen P. B. Pereira attempt to dismiss John Goodman as a somewhat successful star from the late 80's is idiotic and off the mark. You sir are taking the whole movie too seriously. Babe's rough and tumble upbringing left its mark on him. Goodman is terrific throughout the movie,& I really fell for the lovely Trini Alvarado who plays Babe's first wife, she is stunning. As far as the would have, could ofs and other wild speculation on how good Babe would have been, think about this. Babe didn't use illegal steroids like today's ball players, he rode a train not a jet, fitness equipment did not exist. In addition the old ball parks tended to have greater distances from the plate to the fence. I highly recommend this movie, if for just the "pull my finger" line

A consortium of business types gathers in a Manhattan penthouse and sneers at the little people, a slightly overdrawn look at capitalism.

100 Men and a Girl is the story of a group of musicians who are out of work. They seem to be led by one man (Adolph Menjou) whose energetic daughter Patsy (Deanna Durbin) will stop at nothing to see her father and their friends find work. She decides to bother famed conductor Leopold Stokowski for help, but he only becomes annoyed. Instead, she finds a rich woman who promises nonchalantly to sponsor an orchestra if it existed. Patsy proceeds to gain hope and organizes the orchestra only to find that the woman has left for Europe. Patsy decides that her only choice is to berate the woman's husband and Stokowski for support, ensuing great comedy.

Best Possible Sequel made to the Original!!!!!!!!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
First of all, I would have to say is I am deeply moved my this movie. Let me tell all of your Lonesome Dove fans something, DON'T LISTEN TO THERE INSULTS ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, first of all, we don't have TLJ nor Angelica Houston. Those two characters were the major characters in LD next to Gus. But, there is Jon Voight to play Call. Voight may not be the one born for Call like TLJ, but he still does an excelent job and no one except TLJ could have played it better. Barbara Hershey plays Clara. I think she captured the essence of Clara and she did a good job. Rick Shroeder is back and he does a truly unforgetable job as Newt. July Johnson is back along with Pea Eeye. There are some new characters like former texas ranger Gideon Walker, Gus's daughter Agostina Vega, the villian Cheeroke Jack, and a man named Isom who resembles the role of "deets". Although people say that this plot is the same, they are right, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. Just because Mcmurty doesn't write doesn't mean it sucks. It captured the essence that the origianl caught. It had the same beautiful background music. There was a lot of action and adventure and the best part was, the story continued right after Call buried Gus. If you want to have an accurate depiction on what happens to the characters in the original, RTLD definitly shows it. Streets of Laredo is nothing compared to this. This is the true sequel because it delivers the same joy to your heart just like the original. I reccomend this movie to anyone who loves LD and wants to know the continuation of the story. This movie is truly a western. THE EPIC AS BIG AS THE WEST CONTINUES!!!!!!!!!!!

James Wong Howe's cinematography looks beautiful on the restored DVD version of this underrated film, an unearthly intervention which brings us the actual physicality of the 19th century in light and radiance.  It was an era in which electric light was just being invented and candles and gaslight were still the norm, that is, among people with the money to afford them.  The unwashed faces of the coal miners and the families they supported form a canvas from Brueghel, but even the whole weight of the mining companies cannot extinguish the inner spark in their eyes.

A priest who hasn't quiet taken his vows yet.  And last but not least a black redneck mercenaery.  Guys, this is what it is.  Actually it isn't too bad.  Bon Jovi is not the world's greatest thespian (his antics in concert are amazing though).  Don't quit your day job, Jon.  But he still has a certain charm thaat gets you through the film's rough spots.  Arly Jover was cast because she looks good naked, period.  This is a low budget film, but vet horror director Tommy Lee Wallace knows how to make it streach and give us a good time.  Just don't be looking for high atr

What an amazing concert. Paul Simon and a 17-piece backup band supported by a 10-piece Brazilian percussion unit for all of the "Rhythm of the Saints" stuff. This is from 1991, so the content is primarily derived from "Rhythm of the Saints" and "Graceland" plus a smattering of the greatest of his earlier songs, and it's live and energetic and beautiful and for crying out loud there's seriously something like 750,000 people there. A crowd that big is usually reserved for, you know, the Pope or somebody. It's a stirring spectacle.

There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider.

Warren Oates is outstanding!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Truly a great film by Sam Peckinpah with Warren Oates performing masterfully. It starts out somewhat slow and builds the plot til Oates is out for revenge in Peckinpah fashion! Look for Kris Kristofferson as a bad guy biker who gets his just deserves; also Gig Young and Robert Webber as a couple cold ruthless hitmen out to get the prize for their boss. Note that the Mexican land baron is the same fellow who played the general in Peckinpah's "Wild Bunch". All in all a great film full of action and revenge as only Sam Peckinpah could do it! I saw this as a teenager on "Telecinema" in the 70's (the original pay-per-view!) and it is just as powerful now as ever. They don't make movies like this anymore

My favorite Peckinpah film. Yeah, you heard me right. This is the one where we can clearly perceive Sam flying of the deep end, and yet it is still some kind of graceful ugly crazy masterpiece. There are jarring deliberate shifts in tone from lyrical to brutal and ugly to downright surreal. It's willfully sloppy at times, with some shots that don't match at all and some of the worst day for night you've ever seen at one point (that may actually be the fault of MGM's DVD - I don't know). None of that matters a whit. This is a surprisingly heartfelt pitch black comedy with an outstanding squirrelly performance by Warren Oates - and Isela Vega is awesome. "Alfredo" is a road movie from Hell - funny, horrifying and totally captivating. And I don't just mean so-bad-its-good - this is an important film and I love every stinkin' minute of it.

I like this as it was directed by Charles Kaufman, brother of Lloyd Kaufman who made the Toxic Avenger. I give this film a rating of 5 stars and as it is a Troma Inc. release, this is one of the best Troma films I have seen

I bought it on Amazon a few days ago (I saw the movie a long time ago but just now bought it) and got it today. The movie is awesome. Nick Nolte and Martin Short make an awesome team. The story is probably the best part of the entire movie. It's about an ex-con named Lucas (Nick Nolte) who just gets out of jail and immediately gets involved in a bank robbery commited by Ned (Martin Short). There are so many funny scenes on here. Here are the funniest ones:

Too Many Laughs

I first saw this movie on TV in the mid 60's.  My wife and I laughed and snickered through the whole thing.  Then I saw it again, a few years later, while in VietNam.  That was a real hoot with a bunch of guys watching and reacting.  Some 35 or more years later, I remembered it and just had to have a copy for myself.  The entire movie, about how to cheat on your wife and not get caught, is chock full of cameos by readily recognizable stars acting out little scenarios as Robert Morse explains how to go about things to Walter Matthau.  It's a light no-brainer, full of amusing surprises, for aspiring cheats who will have no clue what happens at the very end

I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.

BUY this DVD today.  Be sure to purchase the boxset as it is the only way to get the RICHARD PRYOR SPECIAL? and Mudbone bonus footage.  This groundbreaking series paved the way for not only (the obvious) IN LIVING COLOR and CHAPPELLES SHOW, but other subversive TV like South Park which attempt to inject social commentary while challenging the censors.  It not only captures Pryor at his comedic peak, but gives us early glimpses of folks like Robin Williams, Sandra Berhard, Marsha Warfield and John Witherspoon.  This show has never been available on home video and has basically been out of circulation since its initial run, thus it is a jewel to behold.  Watching Pryor as &quot;The &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;the First Black President&quot; and &quot;Rev. White&quot;--who has his own way to drum up &quot;the big bucks&quot;-- will have you laffing for hours.  But  Pryor also presents scketches that weren't designed to be laugh out loud funny, but challenge you in other ways, like the wino sketch that turns into a Maya Angelo performance. Or the &quot;Satin Doll&quot;  sketch, which has no laughs at all, but aims to capture the feeling of post WWII Black america with a fantastic song-and-dance number starring Paula Kelly (choreographed by Michael Peters.)  I seriously doubt these five hours of television would have come out the same if the NBC censors had been completely undertanding, sensitive and supportive of Mr. Pryor's vision.  The Special is an extension of Mr. Pryor's hosting of SNL. The  subsequent series itself reminds me of Marvin Gaye's HERE, MY DEAR. While it is not Marvin's most listenable or even best work, through pain he finds beauty and truth.  This boxset is a must-have for fans of TV comedy and shoud be copped by any means necessary

Woody's Best (except maybe the earlier, funny ones)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have watched this movie probably 50-60 times, and each time I watch it I love it more.  I think this is Woody at his best, with a great cast and an amazing performance by Nick "Apollo" Forte.  Except for his "earlier, funny" films, which are in a class by themselves, this film has the perfect balance of comedy, drama, dry wit, "suspense", larger-than-life characters....reminds me of "Raging Bull"...but that's a whole 'nuther genre.  As much as I LOVE "Annie Hall", sometimes it seems dated and hard to watch....but "BDR" is timeless.  Do like I did, if you can't decide whether to put down the cash right off the bat...rent it, watch it, and buy it.  I know you will.  Bravo, Woody!  Now, what happened to the rest of your films...??

When I was about 21 or 22 one of my friends flat buddies had it on Beta tape, so I borrowed it cause I still have a Beta(really shouldn't have mentioned that). A true slasher basher not for the timid, truly written and directed by booby hatch patients, and were they found the actors is beyond me! Filmed in georgeous New Jersey of course not far from the original Friday the 13th. Its a real winner!!! Creepiest Mom ever. Love her old dodge or plymouth?

The preview really drew me into the movie before I watched it. It was pure fun, and an excellent sci fi movie. Dolph Lundgreen was the main source for finding this movie, thanks Dolph! Where the heck are you these days? I didnt check all reviews but at the very, very end of the movie Skeltor comes on and says "I'll be back". Ha! Guess that movie never happened.

An Orson Welles Classic
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The classic comes to the screen and is reincarnated as a classic film.  The film gives just the right touches of a dark moodiness.  Welles is excellent as Edward Rochester, the tormented master of the house.  Joan Fountaine is wonderful as Jane.  Look for a very young Elizabeth Taylor in one of her earliest roles.  This material has been done many times but watch this version

Brooding portrayal of heroine in Bronte's book
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have the VHS tape of JANE EYRE, starring Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles. Felt both characters were well-cast, with the quiet and sensitive Fontaine as Jane Eyre, and the brooding, inscrutable Orson Welles as her employer, Mr. Edward Rochester. The black-and-white movie is more suitable for this genre, in my opinion, than the color version, as it depicts more accurately the brooding and eerie qualities of Thornfield Hall, the Rochester residence where his mad wife (of whom Jane knows nothing) is shut up in one of the towers in an unused part of the house with her "keeper" Grace Poole.  I felt the acting as well as the cinematic quality of this movie accurately reflect the atmosphere that Charlotte Bronte was trying to portray in her novel.

This is an inspiring movie to ALL Americans at this stage of the war vs Japan...in reality, 4 of the captured USAAF crew were beheaded, others tortured unmercifuly...3 survived  at war's end...with the release of, "The Purple Heart" at Christmas time [1944] well after the Gen Doolittle raid in April 1942, it hit home and in our hearts to the heroics of our courageous United States Army Air Force and Naval Forces in harm's way...this movie depicts Japan for all of her quick grabs in the Pacific War; yet, Japan was wide open and vunerable to air attack...it helped lift our morale to perservere, sacrifice and no more surrenders, ultimately paving the way for Japan's unconditional surrender forevermore in Aug/1945...it was NOT a propaganda movie; conversely, a cornerstone film for total victory over Japan who was our most formidable and cunning enemy we ever faced on the sea and on the land...Dana Andrews stirring lecture to that Japanese judge rang true as the "USAAF will blackened your skies, day and nite we'll come to burn your cities to the ground and wipe your dirty little Empire off the face of the earth"...that was a TRUISM and justly so...sadly, today's liberal Americans can't relate or comprehend to just what a UNITED effort it took to bring the Japanese Militarists to extinction in Aug/1945...the Japanese got what they readily deserved with A-Bomb interest...this movie was a harbinger of what was to come to the home-islands of Japan...WW2 was a great American lesson to America's enemies...I loved this wartime 1944 film about wartime April/1942....SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FM

The movie is a bit dramatic at times, but those who have studied the Doolittle raid and the treatment of the 8 men captured know it does not tell the American public enough about the terrible way humans treat other humans. If the Americans had been able to know how badly their prisoners were being treated, the Japanese Island might not be there today. Read Four Came Home for the best view, or study other exerpts of various items on the internet. I am writing about Dean Edward Hallmark, a graduate of Paris Junior College and one of the three who were executed

The Immortal Yi Soon Shin is the BEST drama I have seen ever. Korean, American, doesn't matter! This is better than anything I have ever seen on TV or in the movies. Hollywood cannot touch this one! Kim Myoung Min(Yi Soon Shin) is outstanding in this!(no wonder he won the 2005 KBS BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR IYSS)It starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional, funny, sad, and can make you angry!! The numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal!! He put his country above all else and Kim Myoung Min did a great job of portraying that!

Veronica Mars is my favorite show currently on television. Although the show has been focusing more on Veronica's romantic relationship than in the past, the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode. The writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show. The acting for the most part is top notch, and Kristen Bell, who plays Veronica, is amazing. I especially enjoyed Episode 9, Spit and Eggs, in which Veronica figures out who has raped her fried Parker and at least two other women on her campus.

Don't get me wrong...I'm as likely as anyone else looking for a "chick flick" to watch the latest Meg Ryan movie with the cute leading man....but this movie adds something extra. Instead of just dishing out the same old blather that most romantic comedies spout (girl & guy meet, girl & guy go through some conflict, but eventually guy & girl get together and live happily ever after) this movie actually takes the time to explore what makes a relationship between two people special and unique, whether that relationship is between two friends, lovers, or family members.

in a small, quaint bookshop, in which the paint is peeling from the mismatched bookcases, and the view of the sea below is as crisp and clear as it possibly can be from the wavy, leaded glass windows.  Now picture coming back to this town every summer, visiting old friends, spending your Fourth of July evening at the local park.  This movie is more about mood to me than anything.  I watch it over and over every summer, wishing I could be a bookseller in Loblolly-by-the-Sea.  I can almost smell the salty air and taste the lobster in the local restaurant.  This film is a love letter to the romantic in all of us who wishes to spend time curled up with a good book (or movie) on a lazy summer day.

This is a surprisingly good show.

A modern Nancy Drew, is Veronica Mars. I wish seasons 1 and 2 were here; I wish anything more were here and I'd get that as well. I'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest, I prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent TV to sell me in that genre so I bought VM season 3 just for kicks. I'm glad I did

Eyewitnesses are given too much credibility and are notoriously inaccurate. Conspiracy buffs have fashioned an industry out of events told and retold but this footage is the best witness. It is also horrific to watch. I had heard the Parkland surgeons all talk about a head wound behind the President's right ear. They should know, they were there right? The film shows otherwise. If there is a conspiracy it is a well kept secret, show me someone who can keep a secret. If the US government is hiding evidence why is this footage available? No one can tell where a shot came from by the target's movement. The answer to where JFK's missing brain is here, the third shot pulverized it, turning it into a red mist. Had this film never existed the conspiracy people would have made millions more but the answers to their questions are in this footage. This is history which cannot be retold by bad historians or knuckleheads. See for yourself

My GirlfriendTold Me She Used To Go To Bed With Dead Guys! T

Jane Fonda plays a washed up has been actress in this movie with a very bad drinking problem. She wakes up one morning next to a guy with a knife in his chest and she can't remember what happened the night before. Then she is on the run when she meets a sympathetic young man played by Jeff Bridges.Unlike Hitchcock movies when the violins start to screetch on the soundtrack then you knw something VERY BAD is going to happen. The violins in this movie play pretty loud but nothing happens. I figured out "Whodunnit" in the first 30 minutes of this film and then spent the next hour trying to figure out if Fonda's hair was a wig or did she get her own hair bleached blonde?I give this movie 5 stars because I liked the look of the loft where the dead guy lives

"The River"
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The art of farming is by far the oldest, most time-honored tradition. It is the ideal way to make an honest living, raise your family away from the madness of the city and gain self-satisfaction by doing something that really matters. "The River" effectivly portrays the plight experienced by many American farmers during the 1980's economical recession. Flooding, forclosure and overdue bills were just a part of life for those most discouraging and undeniably frightning of years. Farm-friendly legislation has been passed in recent years so farmers can apply for disaster relief, equipment loans and bankrupcy loans. The goal is to keep the Family Farm as part of American culture. "The River" was shot in Northwestern Tennessee near Kingsport, Bristol and Johnson City and also in Birmingham, Alabama. A 400-acre parcel of land alongside the Holston River, in Tennessee was cleared and turned into a real working farm in just four weeks. The flood scenes were produced in conjunction with the Tennessee Valley Authority using a dam upriver which was slated for repairs. The scenery in the movie is absolutly breathtaking. The mountains, fields and river all seem to blend into one big beautiful picture. "The River" was the third in a trio of farming-based movies that year. The other two are "Country", with Jessica Lange and "Places In the Heart" with Sally Field

I think this movie goes right to the heart of the philosophical question of what art and artists are supposed to be and do: are they merely to present facts/ideas/personalities/images with no comment, no moralizing, no personal ulterior motives (leaving all those things to the viewer), or do they need to state clearly a moral purpose and certain direction (which the viewer can then accept or reject)?

CSI is great and Downloading was very easy.  This is my fourth video, and I've only had problems with one, and Amazon quickly walked me through fixing it.  Gotta agree with A. Huck on the DSL, though.  While it's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great

CD version necessary to understand fame/power karma
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
If you are interested in knowing what challenges monarches and other powerful people face, this movie is a great beginning. You may or may not be interested in Russian history or even world history, but this particular story greatly encapsulates the emotional, physical and political issues faced by two powerfully-born adults and their children. Other reviews at this site are terrific for their critical perceptions of this movie and its strengths and weaknesses, so I will not go into too much detail to "sell" anybody on the action or dialogue, or historical accuracy. Suffice to say this movie -- in its unedited version (crucial for DVD) does in fact tell it like it is (or was). Nicholas and Alexandra were two human beings who happened to be born into the Western dynastic system still prevalent at the turn of the 20th century. They were responsible, in an almost Biblical sense, for the destiny of Humanity, only they opted out, and were then executed. This would be considered "romantic" if Humanity did not have such an overwhelming need for Leadership by designated heroes. The DVD version is critical to see the full relationship between Alexandria and Rasputin as a surrendering of power, and also to see Rasputin in his full decadent expression (which must be positively repulsive to Russian history revisionists.) It is also necessary, in an emotional and historic context, to see the "failure" of Nicholas -- that he could no longer carry the responsibility of the godhead. It is also relevant to see the execution of Rasputin at the hands of the two hop-head fairies who were also in line to inherit this godhead, and that they themselves had dreams of American incorporation. Alexia (Nicholas and Alexandra's only son, who also happened to be a hemophiliac) hates his persecutors with a very personal, adult hatred -- those who persecuted the Romanov dynasty were people who hated themselves and took that hatred out on the leaders they loved and despised. They loved their leaders, and despised their need for leaders. If you purchase this movie, whatever your reason or interest, please buy the DVD so that it is unedited (meaning uncensored) so thatyou may judge for yourself

All hail the Cryptkeeper!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Tales from the crypt as you might know is the popular horror series that was on HBO during the early ninties so this film is the first movie to be made from that series. The film is absolutley fantastic and has alot of gore, nudity and humor in it unfortunately the sequal that was released after this was terrible and wasn't even worth it anyway the film starts of with a small segment where the cryptkeeper is directing a horror film then tells his usual stuff like some lame jokes then the real film starts with a car chase and offcourse Billy Zane as the collector was fantastic in his role he was hillarious and scary at the same time, William Sadler plays Brayker who is a drifter that stumbles upon a motel and its inhabitants and is trying to hide from the collector who happens to want a medalion that Brayker has, the collecter also summons up some demons from hell in a very cool scene so he could create alot of havoc, the film was also an homage to older horror films like the evil dead and night of the living dead as you'll see later when the characters are all stuck in this motel surrounded by demons. All the characters were great in this film and you also get a bit of background with each one of them which is rare especialy in a gory horror film like this. The film also stars Jada Pinket Smith, CCH Pounder who gets her arm ripped off in this film and Thomas Haden Church who plays the obnoxious jerk and some other actors that I don't recognise all this makes for a great and enjoyable horror film that I highly recomend that you watch

Finally, it presents some moral and ethical questions

But it's the core 25%, and if you look at this as its own piece, then you'll be satisfied.  The visuals are great, Gary Cooper is great, and Ayn Rand's premise is all here.

The Difficulty Of Being A Good Buddhist

Many people, when they think of Buddhism, think of blissful meditation and serene contemplation. This movie graphically depicts the other side of Buddhism;i.e., hard work in the real world, in the real transformation of oneself and in one's efforts to help other beings, no matter how difficult or horrific the circumstances.

Italians Do IT Better-Just Ask Sophia!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Sophia Loren is without arugment the most beautiful and sexy foreign actress in movie history. Beginning in the mid-1950's she did a string of Italian films and became the first foreign-born actress to come to Hollywood and make the crossover in mainstream American movies, starting with "The Pride and the Passion" in 1957 (it was this film and "Houseboat" that Loren began her close relationship with Cary Grant) and at the same time, blew fellow Italian bella Gina Lollobridga out of the water as the best actress to come out of Italy. In 1960, Loren went back to Italy to film the World War II film "Two Women." A year and a half later, to everybody's surprise she won the Oscar for Best Actress and became the first foreigner of that era to win the Academy Award. But if there was one film that summed up just how damn sexy Sophia Loren was, it came with "Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow." The scene in which she strips in front of Marcello Mastronini's character has to be considered the greatest strip scene in film history and also the most sexiest in film history too (Hope PREMIERE magazine does a list like it someday). And that is the scene in which you say to everybody, "This is Sophia Loren." In my opinion, Loren may have been the first actress in movie history to be on-screen in their lingerie. There is a shirt that says, "Italians Do it Better." Could 'it' be referring to sex? if so, we can give thanks to Sophia Loren.

This film's predecessor,"Ginger Snaps 2--Unleashed," was a competent but uninspired effort: a typical sequel.  In contrast, "Ginger Snaps Back" is a significant film--but hardly a sequel at all.

All bow down to the producers at Criterion, who have done an outstanding job of bringing to DVD one of the best Rock films ever made, GIMME SHELTER.  The film itself has been reviewed to death over the past thirty years, so I won't do that here.  I will, however, let 'cha know that beyond Criterion's beautiful, vibrant, remixed, remastered presentation lies a world of wonderful extras: 1) commentary by filmmakers Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, 2) audio material from the four-hour day-after program  broadcast by KSAN on December 7, 1969, 3) three different trailers for the film, 4) trailers for other Maysles Brothers films, 5) 5.1, 2.0 stereo and DTS sound mixes, 6) outtake footage including performances of "Oh, Carol" and a nice acoustic "Prodigal Son", 7) a studio mixing session with the band for "Little Queenie", 8) an extensive stills gallery, 9) a HUGE book with much material on the film and the filming, and lots more.  GIMME SHELTER is a must-own for your video Rock library.  Thank you, Criterion

One, two, Freddy's comin for you......a third time....and this time 3's a charm!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Ohhhhhhhhhh my my my, what can I say about this one?  By the time it entered home video on vhs in late 1987, I was not familiar with Freddy at all except for the fact that I knew the premise....he can kill in your dreams and goes after kids and teens.  The fact that I was at that time only goin on age 15 did not help.  I was terrified of anything related to horror.  In my mind Freddy was the worst.  As a scared 15 year old kid, Freddy was the last thing I wanted to view.  I was watching films like, Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back.  Those I could handle.  However, in late summer of 1987, a friend of mine rang me up and told me to come over because he had a new movie he had rented that he wanted me to watch.  I asked him what it was and he wouldnt tell me.  All he said was that id be surprised and that id really like it.  So, I went over and he wouldnt let me see the title on the box.  He just slid it into the slot of the VCR.  Folks, I saw the New Line Cinema Logo and then this graphic,  "Sleep, those little slices of death.  How I loathe them....Edgar Allan Poe"  My mind started to reel but I had not yet realized what this film was; and then I saw the title, "A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS."  Now mind you the closest I ever came to seeing this film was the wonderfully cool Dokken Video on MTV called, Dream Warriors.  I even had a hard time viewing the visage of Freddy in that MTV video.  Hilarious huh??  Anyway, when I saw the title come up, I grabbed my coat and I was getting the hell out of there and quickly.  However, my buddy begged me to give it a chance, he said its not as bad as I was thinkin and that id actually find certain parts of it actually funny.  Now I thought he was pullin my leg with that statement.  Even his mother told me id like it.  She had already seen it in the theatres and so had my buddy.  So, once I heard her reassure me as well, I decided to give it a chance.  As the opening of the film carried on I viewed the front cover on the box.  A vicious looking cover with Freddy's face leering over several teens facing him, appearing to stand on his out-stretched knives with a tagline that I find today to be one of the most creative taglines ever!!!  "If you think you'll get out alive, you must be dreaming."  Anyhow, suffice it to say, after experiencing dream warriors, I was instantly relieved and I was also an instant fan!!  I couldnt believe it actually because id sworn this character off.  I was terrified of him.  I suppose id have to thank my buddy Mike C. for that.  Thank you Mike for opening the door to this series for me.  Ive loved it ever since.  Ive seen all of them.  Many argue and argue over which film is the best, but Dream Warriors will always hold a special place in my heart because it was my first Nightmare and the first time I had to get ready for Freddy!!  :)  Hope you enjoyed my review.   By the way, I did laugh during my first viewing, and I also feel that poster art was the best of all of them
