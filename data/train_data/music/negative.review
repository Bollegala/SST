Low Frequency rumble that repeats about every 45 seconds makes this recording useless for me to relax with
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
After carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on Amazon and reading all reviews I had hoped I had made a good choice with this CD.  Unfortunately I discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my Bose Tri-Port headphones.  As a recording engineer I recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground.  The bottom line is I hear this rumble each and everytime I start to relax and it renders the CD completely useless to me.  The recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic.  Since nobody else has complained of this rumble, I will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear

Out of all of the early '90s, L.A. gangster flicks, this one probably had the best set of Chicano oldie tracks.  The movie was laced with them, yet none are on the soundtrack.  Kind of a waste.

Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original.

Rob touches on so much with this CD.  My favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my opinion, the public missed out a great hit!  "Streetcorner Symphony" is about people coming together. It's what I call my happy song.  Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I can get it!  We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also called it a happy song!  I can't wait for his live albulm to come out! There are fast and slow songs on this CD and will be worth EVERY PENNY you spend to buy it! Incredible voice and songwritting

Thank you Kristy for proving to be yet another white suburban supporter of the most mass marketed crap to come along. (Missy)This song is soo done it's practically taboo to listen too. And Outkast?

A prime example of "When Gangsta Rap Goes Wrong"
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the Mid Nineties G-Funk heyday. Warren G. didn't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before. The skits are ridiculous, the music is halfass, and the lyrics are amateur. There is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener's attention for a whole album. This is similar to other West Coast rap albums that play it too safe such as W.C. and the Madd Circle's debut and Coolio's "It Takes A Thief". One star for the hit single "Summertime in the L.B.C.".

Any group that is so lacking in imagination that it has to steal as unusual and distinctive a song title as "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" (a 1934 hit song) deserves to be ridiculed, not rewarded with a Grammy.

I woke up this morning to the grating sounds of "Good Little Girls" blaring over my clock radio's single, worn-out speaker.  A speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year, such as "There Goes My Life" and "Live Like You Were Dying".  "Good Little Girls" is easily the worst country song I've ever heard - and I thought Neal McCoy was bad!  Blue Country is the C&W equivalent of Wham!  (a dated reference to be sure)

I agree with all the other reviewers .. nice quality recording for its time considering it was in the vaults for decades ..great playing  from all concerned(except the  cursed Drummer) , I cannot imagine what poor Jerry Gemmot went through with THAT DRUMMER .. he should have been  dismissed immediately ..or shot ..it would have sounded better without him .. Gawd' awful .. spoils the whole dang thing .. any way .. I cannot listen to this anymore without getting uncomfortable , so it's back to Soul Of A Man , Re-Kooperation ,  Live Adventures , Super Session , and Kooper Sessions with Shuggie

Anyone ever see any of these rap "artists" perform live? They're the most boring, derivative "entertainers" in the world. They walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and YELL their lyrics. They go from talking on records to yelling on stage. Quite a stretch. All this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying "YEAH!" "UH-HUH!" "WHAT!" "THAT'S RIGHT!" "UH!" etc. Get real.

and he's a super-talented drummer. The day the Foos release a best-of compilation I'll probably pick it up. Otherwise, I'm sad to say that the average Foo Fighters album cut just doesn't cut it for me. All of the songs on THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE are mediocre, run-of-the mill "alternative" rock. Only "Stacked Actors" has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite, but to be perfectly honest, it still isn't a huge turn-on in my book. "Learn to Fly," the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio, may as well have been written by The Outfield or some other average rock band along those lines. I almost gave this album two stars, but unfortunately I think that rating would be just too generous.

This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally.  It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music.  The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.  This is worship manipulation at it's best.  If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance.  They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.  God IS great, but WHY?  This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship.

With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience

I thought something must be wrong with my stereo when I first played this cd.  Brooks and Dunn have created some great work, but this is far from it.  Many of the songs are so dischordant, I would  swear that the studio engineer had gone tone deaf or something.  About two decent songs, the rest are not worth having around.  Try some earlier stuff for a better taste of their talent

While some would call Orange and Acme "studio" albums, suggesting that they lack originality, but they have rythm. I would call myself a big JSBX fan, I play Orange and Acme constantly, however I feel that this album is a little too much free form, and free noise for the everyday listener. I would recommend that anyone interested in JSBX start with Acme and then move on to Orange to develop an appreciation for JSBX, because it is a rather acquired taste

If I was you dont listen to the retards who tell you "this is a good comeback album" . Instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats. A shame they couldn't go to Ja rule, whose CD sucked with his beats. He has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow

Robin Gibb has one of the most distinctive voices of the 1960s. With the BEE GEES or as a solo artist he has enough hits to make his own live show. However, in this LIVE recording he chooses to recreate mostly BEE GEES hits on which he had a secondary role on their famous three part harmonies. Thus he needs the help of another lead singer, chorus and The Neue Philharmonie Frankfurt Orchestra. But everything goes wrong here: Robin's voice remains buried among a real bulk of unmixed music; the lead singer (no list of credits) is a poor substitute to Barry Gibb's famous falsetto; the female voices are not very inspired, to say the least; while the orchestra is frequently out of tune and noisy (the winds on Juliet are really unbearable). Post-production seems to be non-existent and the overall sound is chaotic. Lines notes by experts Andrew Mon Hughes and Ann Grootjans are interesting and illustrative, but they seem to belong to another album. The message from Robin Gibb seems to be clear: "I can do it all by myself". Well, he cannot. He should re listen to ONE NIGHT ONLY (1998) and check for sound, harmonies and production

There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could.

I can't beleive this guy's arrogance to try and re-record songs that are essentially and always will be Sinatra's domain. Any idiot will tell you that once Sinatra got hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him. Fact. Ask Tony Bennett or any other great singers and they will tell you. Sinatra IS the voice and then this upstart thinks he can do better. Not only does he murder 'a very good year' but also attempts (badly) 'mr. bojangles' even attempting to ape Sammy Davis's mannerisms. I had the misfortune to hear this once and came to the conclusion that is was a)a joke or b) a blantant attempt by Williams to crossover to boarder appeal. Now i see it actually meant it. Robbie you will never be able to sing standards and please don't attempt the Rodgers and Hart songbook (though i suspect you will if your latest album bombs) your voice is flat most of the time and your attempts to look cool on the cover can't cover up your mediocrity. The only time i'd like to see you swing is from a lamppost. Stick with 'songs for swinging lovers''come fly with me' to hear the real thing. An insult to classic songs

The lack of someone lurking behind Prince's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the Fargnoli management team. This is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster. Musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to Sade also make the feel of this track disjointed. While Prince fans will generally hype this track, the reality is that "4 the tears in your eyes" this isn't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass. Lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121.

A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).

You know, after REALLY trying to like this album, I must agree with K Johnson. Oftentimes a really good album sounds horrible (or just plain plain) upon one or three spins, so when this album didn't move me the first time, I decided to hang back and try again in a few days. Then again. And again. And one more time. Usually after three or four COMPLETE spins (which was like work, with this one)the jems will work there way to the surface. Sufjian Stevens was like that. So was Z by My Morning Jacket. But the problem was that I really wanted to like this one. All the reviews I read were hyping this as the album of the decade, and I wanted them to be right.

Get Ready For Something or Another
</Text>

On an episode of Seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is, the always wily and oh so goofy character of Kramer is playing a game of Risk and exclaims that the "Ukraine is weeeeak".  This causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble.  I think the same basic sentiments work with this New Order release.  It probably wasn't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent "Rock The Shack" and of course "Crystal", which I'll get back to later.  Unlike Kramer I feel I can make this statement safely as I'm not dealing with a burly, alcohol swigging Ukranian, but New Order fans, which aren't the most intimidating bunch out there.  Keyboardist Gillian Gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important, which it is, maybe.  This album features the guitar of Billy Corgan, the frontman of the seminal 90's group Soundgarden.  Too bad they couldn't get Billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy, and wasn't writing very good material or really using his guitar, at all.  New Order also made the mistake of having Corgan to backing vocals.  Now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough, but to top that off with a Billy Corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice.  So...Someone Like You is more or less unlistenable.  It has some pretty terrible lyrics about how Bernard doesn't want to wash his car.  Now I can relate, I wouldn't want to wash my car in Britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair, but this topic doesn't result in the most captivating and well-written material.  New Order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album, something they don't do very often, just like Van Morrison.  Now I'm not sure if I've heard a Van Morrison song but I've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars.  Case in point of this `not so good of an idea rawking' is Rock The Shack.  Rock The Shack kind of sounds like New Order's take on someone commissioned to write an epic Gilligan's Island rock song, pretty amazing huh?  '60 Miles an Hour', `Primitive Notion', and `Close Range' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland.  New Order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80's artist like Depeche Mode, The Cure, and Tears For Fears (who've actually always blown).  However, they do succeed fully well on two songs here.  There is `Crystal', which is truly an excellent rock song and show New Order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of New Order's career from the 90's and beyond.  How this didn't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me, because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it.  The other is Run Wild which is really a great little slow song, in the vein of `As It Is When It Was.  Probably New Order's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic, moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album.  Get Ready is good beginning and end, just not end between.  Kind of like that movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me

This is not like "Kidz Bop" or anything related to that which "kidifies" music - these are timeless movie classics that did NOT need to be redone - and as a further insult, they are poorly redone.  I am very, very let down by these "Disneymania" albums. :o(

Im not surprised that this album is garbage because fiddy has been putting out trash lately (think tony gayo). There are no standout tracks and prodigy doesnt even rhyme anymore. All prodigy does is spit run-on sentences throughout every track and havoc sounds like he's just there to be there. Amerikaz nightmare was a sign that it was over for them. Did we really have to hear this one to see that? If you are a mobb deep fan buy every album before amerikaz nightmre and keep it moving

..and what's the point? All of these songs (minus a few) are on the anthology, along with countless others. The Beastie Boys didn't put this out, their record label did.  It's just way for corporate to make money. If you consider yourself a real Beastie Boys fan, that is you're interested in all the other music they made that wasn't put on radio, then don't buy this.  If you occasionally heard them on the radio and Fight For Your Right is your favorite song, then go ahead. The Beastie Boys are much more than just their greatest hits.  To fully appreciate them, you have to listen to an album all the way through.

As for many of these kind of unknown groups, the music in the album is useless. In the meaning that this music has no use. It is not relaxing. It is not for contemplation. It is not spiritual. It is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of "ambient". But ambient music is music. THis is crap.

Why are they butchering Pac's songs like this. I advise anyone to get the bootlegs over this album. The original Ghetto Gospel and Loyal To The Game are 2 of my favorite Pac songs but the one's on here are painful to listen to. Afeni should have let DJ Quik, Daz, and whoever else that worked with Pac do this album. They should have just digitally remastered the bootlegs. This started with Still I Rise to Until The End Of Time to Better Dayz and the quality has been going down and down and they hit rock bottom with this one. The 2 stars is 1 because it is Pac and another for the song Uppercut. The most obvious butcher job is Black Cotton where Em chose a fast beat and you could tell he is trying to speed up Pac's rhyme. I hope they do better with this last album due out this year

I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band.  All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception.  Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I.  A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band.  If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total.  If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like &quot;Painful.&quot; But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia

Sarah Brightman is one of my all time favorite artists.  But this disc is just a complete waste.  It is missing so much, and has too many songs that don't belong.  Like the phantom songs.  As much as I love them, save them for the Andrew Llyod Webber collections.  Can't we have a nice singles collection with just her solo works starting from "Dive"?  Her "Classics" album had it right.  Except their version of "Captain Nemo" was the rip off live version.  And THIS cd doesn't even have the Captain Nemo song, which is a HUGE fan favorite, and definitly was a single.  It is also missing How Can Heaven Love Me, Eden, Harem, and Beautiful.  All singles as well.  Save your money.  Either buy the "Classics" album for a somewhat better compilation, or just make your own mix like I did.  Because Sarah has so many wonderful songs (And quite a few bad ones I will admit)  And it seems on here they give you some bad ones (like requium and nella fantasia), and leave out the good ones.  "It's A Beautiful Day" and "What You Never Know" are good, but are the weakest songs form Harem.  Why on earth would you leave out "Harem" and "Beautiful", but leave on Beautiful Day and WYNK?  Whoever put this set list together must have not put much thought into it and is just trying to cash in.  I bet Sarah didn't have much say in this compilation.  This is just a waste.  Beautiful album cover though

It was about time the spell Kasey Chambers originally cast on me wore off - I'd become a huge fan of The Captain and Barricades & Brickwalls, but there was all something a little nagging about even those two very good records.  Chambers, a unique betty boop squeak of a voice, was a lustrous presence in rootsy contexts, and the best moments of those records were snarky updates on an old form, but the worst moments were forgettable alt-country duldrums of patched together cliches.  Wayward Angel, Chambers' third album, had some great songs on it, but its pop and country predictability overtook a good half of the album.  Carnival shows Chambers at her weakest - sad girl anthems of generic empowerment about the rain, bad girl anthems of doin-wrong that sound about as risky as songs on The Disney channel's afternoon lineup.  "Light Up A Candle" fakes its slinkiness and turns dull, "Surrender" adds a Dido production of drum machines and computer bleeps that don't mask the song's epic ordinariness,  ballads like "Dangerous" limp along to their own generic lethargy.  Chambers isn't without charm - "Sign On The Door" and "I Got You Now" are impossible to not find fun - yet Chambers worst instincts as a song writer threaten to take over even the good songs - "Hard Road," a sad and moving movie-ready duet, borders on self-parody - lines like "There's a heavy jacket/ there's a heavy load/ there's a weight on my shoulders/ it's a hard road" read like a laundry list of related lines from every sad and moving movie-ready song you've ever heard

as much as I have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled "chemistry"between buckshot and 9th Wonder.  The beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone.  they are working on a part two so I hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was.

Charlotte Church had the most beautiful and captivating voice I ever heard when she debuted.  I purchased all of her albums and played them to death. This CD is horrible!  Her beautiful voice is no more as she makes no attempt to even use it.  Some of the other reviews said this release is the result of her growing up.  Ridiculous!  She could easily have kept the angelic voice as she grew.  This is simply a tragic waste of talent

The Schumann that is presented here is a forgery. Don't get me wrong. I'm not railing against Schumann at all. The question here is what makes Schumann great, and the way that Bernstein presents these symphonies says Schumann is great for the wrong reasons. The real Schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music. Schumann was not a hopeless romantic. He was one composer in a long line of "classicists" which ended with Brahms, yet at the same time he was an innovator, pushing forward, trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression. He had plenty of dignity, and he didn't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him, which is exactly what it sounds like here. Bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying. Yes, many of these performances are the slowest on record, but this is a BAD thing. These beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick, waxy, overly romantic textures and phrasing. Tell me, did Schumann ever write: "To be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically, with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics" in his score? No! HE DID NOT. These performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word, and any person in his/her right mind should be able to see this. You may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in Karajan's filth, but that's not saying much at all. And for this slight favor Bernstein does for the music, he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit. The most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony, taken at half tempo. All semblance of melody and motion is lost. This movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first, and not the longest movement of the symphony, not to mention the longest movement in the entire set. In fact, almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing. Also, while looking at the scores, you might notice that Bernstein does away with detail work this time around. Carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand "romantic" gestures. Observing details in Schumann, ironically, helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly. This isn't honest music-making here, only a self-indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art

Gives Celine a run for her money? Please!!!! The only singer she sounds better than is Paris Hilton! But whatever. If you like it, that's all that matters.

I would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever WRONG with the band Jet, but when you don't have any particular characteristics to call your own, there's nothing to complain about. Of course, this means that there's nothing to compliment, either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary, clich d classic rock, except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago. If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the classic rock stations, not the modern rock stations. Those are for the new songs, only.

If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player.  but if your children are six and up.  Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs.  This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it.  This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap.  Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old.  pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa.  This is Pop music for impoverished folks

Clipped, petite and looking more like a leather bar Anne Murray, Crow drags out the hits and the `friends' for this all-star live bash. Half the album is standard issue and straight ahead stage sweat with the morning beer-buzz afficiando going it alone without a little help from her friends (All I Wanna Do, Everyday Is a Winding Road, A Change Would Do You Good, Leaving Las Vegas). With only slight variations on these overplayed originals (a sychopantic crowd and some tinkering with the rhythms) Crow's solo chores rarely rate more than a grudging ho-hum. The rest of the album is a parade of snap-on tools (Dixie Chicks, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Sarah McLachlan, Chrissie Hynde) who easily steal the spotlight from their downhome hash-slinging waitress/host. Reduced to the role of supporting guitarist, Crow butters the toast from the sidelines as femme contemporaries like Nicks (who unravels admirably on Gold Dust Woman), Hynde and McLachlan flounder about the mike in a haphazard hit (Hynde's If It Makes You Happy)-and-miss (McLachlan's The Difficult Kind) headbutt at Crow's hits. But it isn't until Clapton's suspendered, cigar-chomping husk is rolled out to update Cream's White Room that the sour stench of monstrous micalculation reaches it's devastating climax. Fresh from watering the daisies and still in his jammies, Clapton's return to the electric psychedelics of his Paleolithic past  is a fumbling bumbling fiasco unleashed with the grace and finesse of a diarrhetic Brontosaurus. It's horrifying to think that this is what Cream would have sounded like if they hadn't broken up. Thank God for egos. It's almost a relief to hear Richards mindlessly croak his way through the old Stones Exile-era toss-off Happy, as if a cadaverous ex-junkie with the durability of a cockroach and nine lives would be anything but. Besides, Richards provides wonderful comic relief and criticizing his artistic capacity is as futile as pointing out the flaws in the bandages on an Egyptian mummy. The wrapper finds the entire gang, from Spanky Nicks to Buckwheat Clapton, joining hands for a bizarre entreaty with a kindergarten  rendition of Dylan's Tombstone Blues - a fitting finale if there ever was one

This is the #1 Worse Song of 2006 (#2 is "SexyBack" by Justin Timberfake). For real. His voice is awful and I don't know who is worse: James Blunt, Macy Gray, or Shakira. Imagine the three of them doing a performance together on a stage. It would be pure he11

This apparently is equal to that D4L s***, which is actually the lowest of the low. Anyways, didn't I tell you Chingy would die one year after -Jackpot- hit?

Copies Amazed power-ballad success way too much
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Lonestar didn't really surprise me with their 2001 effort.  I'm Already There and Not A Day Goes By suffers from "Amazed" syndrome.  Amazed's 1999 multi-format mega success is spread all over this album, their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad.  Did they listen to Monster Ballads 2 too much while making this album in Nashville? I'm Already There comes off as very Diane Warren-ish in its sappy lyrics.  Their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay, but these songs don't work for them.  These songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this.

Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.

A lot of people are saying that this album is better than their 1st one. That's not saying much because their 1st album was terrible. There was only one direction they could go -- up. It's hard to imagine them doing worse than their first LP. I said this about the Young, Fly, & Flashy album, and the same applies here, so I'll say it again: When the hottest line on your entire album comes from Bow Wow, your album is in serious trouble. But let me balance that statement though. This isn't exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical gymnastics. This is simple, bass heavy, crunk music. It's effective in it's purpose, but it's totally generic (the recipe for most party songs). And some of these songs are just flat out horrible. "Stop Callin' Me" isn't only horrible, but it isn't about anything if you're paying attention to the wack lyrics DFB put on it (and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped). And who's idea was it to let Dame Dash (yeah, THAT Dame Dash) scream all over a song (Bricks 4 The High)? I want to know who the guy was that said "yeah, that's a good idea". Dame is doing what he does best, so he's not at fault.....I blame the idiot that put him on the song. "Suckas Come And Try Me" is probably the worst song to come out of the south since Drama dropped his album. And if you ask me, the "White Tee" remix was a step backward from the original. It would help if they could talk about something other than "haters", postin' up on the block (I swear they say that on the album at least 100 times), rims, jewelry, and weed. But expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part I guess. Besides, if people buy this, why should they change? That's another story though. In short, the album fails to seperate DFB from the pack. The beats are generic and the rhymes are terrible ("I'll make you 1 2 step like Ciara"? Come on, I could write that in my sleep) And it's hard to tell if there are four rappers or just one because they all sound similar.

I'm surprised this show got past Season 1. Honestly, more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar. This show does NOT discover talent, they produce and market it. It is really demeaning to musicians everywhere. The judges are a joke, I guess the producers tell them what to say. Simon "the jerk" Cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone, hey...he has made a living out of it. Randy Jackson's vocab is limited to "yo", "yeah" and "dawg". Paula, who's the only one who I think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone, be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/(fill with any word of your choice). All in all, a total disaster...only in shows this sh*tty, can no-talents like William Hung be hailed as a celebrity. I am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers. On a more positive note, it's good that people don't actually buy the albums, thus resulting in total disappearing acts from Idol winners like Ruben and Fantasia...now we just need the American public to stop tuning in to the shows. Well, hope is all we have, right

It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times.  Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived.

This Might Not Be the Album You Want

I purchased this album because I am a fan of the Last Poets.  Upon listening to the samples provided by Amazon.com, I thought I was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats.  However, when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like "Get Out of the Ghetto Blues."  If more of the tracks had the sound of the title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion.  True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album, but not in the form I had hoped for.  I would take the Last Poets' album "This Is Madness" over this particular Scott-Heron album

Boo-Wop? haha ok, anyways I bought his through Middle-Piller distro. and it's got a couple of o.k. songs on it. The problem is the singing and the overall production. This is definetely a home-recording on computer deal. The vocals are waaaaay weak. What exactly is a "re-worked" debut album??? I thought once an album was out it was done, set in stone? Apparently not,so mister monster gets to pull a Blitzkid (who changed their first album cover years after it came out!) and take the cheezy way out. A definete step up from bands like Blitzkid,but still in the cellar of rock n roll. Do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years

The music of Dowland is wonderful - but Sting isn't up to interpreting it. You can't even distinguish the words half the time, just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. This music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...Sting, for all his merits, hasn't got that in his repertoire yet.

Bunnymen go 'mainstream'?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers

Metallica never recovered from the death of Cliff Burton, as this album is prime evidence of.  He helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here.  Also, Newstead only gets one song on this album, which is ironically the best song on the album.  In the history of Metallica, this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial

Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo.  These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording.  That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms.

Use this as Sunday background music on a rainy day; but do not expect to get the party started with this album...

Great voice --lousy arrangements
</Text>
</title>
<text>

I love his voice, but the arrangements are way too complex and stilted.  There are about 12 key changes in every song.  The melodies are buried so far beneath his reinterpretations that one can barely recognize the songs. I feel these affectations detract from the songs.  While his vocal gymnastics are very impressive, the result just isn't enjoyable to listen to (unless you are a voice student or professional singer)

Do not buy this cd, the first two reviews said this is a good cd. NOPE. I'll tell ya the real about this cd. I believe this was 305's first cd, and I don't see how this cd was ever in mass production. While It does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist. 305 got much of the material for this cd on Techmaster P.E.B's masterpiece Bass Computer. Any one who has both cd's can tell. If your looking for bass, you'll find it here. But you can find knock with any bass artist. I give this cd one star for biting Techmaster

Just listening to the samples of this new remix of "GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters" I found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. Certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent Of Karen Carpenter and Richard as well. I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these songs? As another review noticed and I agree with, is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of Karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. This is not a CD you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of The Carpenters. The older CDs (if still in production or if you can find them used) "Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary" a 2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally, is a much better pick. Especially for those who remember The Carpenters when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with. The other CD's worth finding of The Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen's deep resounding perfect voice, would be The CD "Voice Of The Heart" This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song. The other one I would highly recommend, if Christmas is your Holiday, would be "Carpenters Christmas Portrait"... "Special Edition digital version....Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons best..." with Karen and Richard. There are 34 Carpenters songs as timeless as their sound,and 11 performances heard on this Holiday CD for the first time. These CDs are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard Karen sing. These are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard. This new remix maybe OK if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs The Carpenter's recorded and later remastered-Not Remixed- sounded. For this reason I give this 35th Anniversary remix a 2 star rating. These older CDs are how The Carpenders really won over their fans, took the Music Industry by storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. Talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only The Carpenters could deliver. As I more or less said in my Title for this review and taken from an old saying "if it ain't broke don't fix it!" or in this case Don't Remix it!

I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.

When it comes to Big Star's 70's output, you can call me a HOPELESS FANBOY, because after listening to In Space, it seems that ONLY a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later, exactly one-half of the classic Big Star lineup could---or in forever difficult Alex Chilton's case, WOULD be so inclined---to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great.  This disc has WAY MORE in common with Chilton's oft-times difficult, mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of Big Star's previous fascinating pop near-perfection. While I'll admit that I have enjoyed a good chunk of Chilton's solo work, (in a slightly guilty, rolling-my-eyes, "Oh...that Alex!" sorta way...) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that THIS group and that THIS particular collection of songs are presented as "Big Star."  In Space is connected musically to the original Big Star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in THIS BAND were in THAT BAND.  If you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.

For some very odd reason, the compiler at the record company decided to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember.  For all we know, it may have been a copyright problem. I bought this for my Dad about 5 years ago, but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it. The live recordings on this CD are dismal and not related to the awesome "Hot August Night".

..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women.  First it was Britney Spears, then it was Christina Aguilera, now it's Joss Stone.  The former at least have something going for them; Britney's first album had catchy beats, and even though Aguilera's style is incredibly trashy, she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard.

I admit to being curious about Rihanna's music because like a previous poster from Brooklyn stated " I was not trying to become a Rihanna fan!!".  I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this disc and although Rihanna is no vocal powerhouse, the songs on the disc were produced in such a way as to mask this fact and create more than a few enjoyable songs.

This is nothing like the classic dead you've heard about.  Far from it.  The sound is too polished.  &quot;Alabama Get Away&quot; and &quot;Althea&quot; are okay but the rest is junk.  I think most dead heads would agree that this is not the one to look for if you just want some of the Deads' best music.  Really... The Grateful Dead with a polished sound??  Just doesn't seem to fit.  Save your money for one of their greatest hits compilations,plus American Beauty, Worjing Man's Dead, Europe '72 and &quot;Dead Set&quot;

First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable

I bought this album because I loved the title song.  It's such a great song, how bad can the rest of the album be, right?  Well, the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't worth the money I paid for this. It's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. Kenny Chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the Nashville music scene.  He's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town.  I'll get down off my soapbox now.  But country music really needs to get back to it's roots and stop this pop nonsense.  What country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things.

This album is ultimately forgettable-- better off listening to any Jimmy Eat World CD again and again, which is actually an enjoyable experience

If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you.  If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it.  I had such high hopes for this CD after the Robert Johnson CDs and the Cream reunion, but all winning streaks must come to an end, and Clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this.  Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them.  I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me

Kate Bush's second album, "Lionheart", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing "The Kick Inside Part Two", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so.

Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its played out

I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so "out there" that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the CD.

Understand, I love Springsteen.  Born to Run is my second favorite album of all time.  I have seen him live over a dozen times.  I personally think he is the single most important American rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to Elvis, Chuck Berry and Dylan).  I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this album is unlistenable.

Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, &quot;Reptile,&quot; makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with &quot;Backless,&quot; &quot;Another Ticket,&quot; and &quot;Money &amp; Cigarrettes&quot; all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans

This is anything but soothing. The tone is too high pitched; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky Carmel coastline that I was hoping for. I did buy the twofer and got the Ocean Surf CD by Dan Gibson and found it much more relaxing, even though it isn't a tumbling surf sound. I was able to fall asleep... which was my goal. Now if I could only return Ocean Waves.

Shannon Lawson is capable of a much better album.  I saw him down in Nashville when he was with the Galoots, and it was amazing!  If they were to put out a CD I'm sure it would be one of my favorites.  Shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that's what Nashville should have let him do on his first solo CD.  Instead they gave it this generic, overproduced sound, leaving Shannon sound like everyone else.  With the way bluegrass is selling these days, it's a shame that Shannon couldn't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena..

As a fan of Pete Seeger's music, I bought this CD in the hope that the family connection would ensure similar quality of the music.  Disappointingly, I've found this album really grates on me after a couple of songs.  Peggy's vocal style in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the length of the album, as her delivery can best be described as a neo-hillbilly twang.  I may end up combining the best half-dozen songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a listenable &quot;best-of&quot; set, but I'd find it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting.  Only devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set; more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of Pete's fine albums such as the Carnegie Hall classic

Nelly gets worse and worse with each release
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Okay, I used to think that Nelly was a fun guy to listen to. He made songs that I used to enjoy, such as St. Louis, E.I., Country Grammar, and Ride Wit Me off of the CD "Country Grammar". Then there were a good amount of other good songs on "Nellyville". And the good thing about these CDs was that there were not too many skip tracks. But with Nellyville, Nelly brought us the obnoxious Hot In Herre, a single that got plenty of radio playtime, but I could not stand. This was not a good sign for the future. Then comes these two new CDs, Sweat and Suit. I have not listened to most of Suit, but I have listened to most of this, and it is pure garbage. This is the same Nelly who made Hot In Herre for sure. It has a bunch of catchy songs that live off the beats and the hook to drive them to get radio playtime. Most of the tracks are much worse than Hot In Herre, if that is believable. I just want a decent CD from Nelly, I am not expecting a classic. Instead he drops the definition of materialistic garbage, and I shake my head in disgust. Avoid this one and get one of his older CDs, or a CD from a better artist

With much anticipation we awaited the arrival of Clay's second album, thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career.  While Clay's voice still sounds great, the CD is an entire collection of uninspired, underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original.  As you can see, this CD is nowhere on the billboard charts, and we're very sad to say in our household, that it's for good reason.  Save your money and buy one of the much better Idol CDs ... and almost any of them are, most recently Kelly Pickler and Carrie Underwood.

Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.

As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.

Ruining our children
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am a 23 yr old mother of a 2 1/2 yr old. Not only are these children HORRIBLE singers, but there is a reason that most parents don't let their children listen to the original songs... they teach them things they don't need to know.   I thought this would be a "kids" version that would get rid of that stuff when I let a child I was babysitting put the cd on... and was appalled at how much they talked about sex and other innappropriate things for children.  They didn't take that out!  Children are exposed to that every day in our world now, telling them it is "normal" and "ok".  Parents have a big enough job to teach their children right and wrong with the way the world is today.  It becomes a much harder job when you give them something that is for "kids" that teaches them that those things are "normal".  They assume if it is ok for a kids cd, it can't be that bad.  I think this is horrible and would never spend a penny on it for a child!  Some of the songs I like in the originial version and do listen to, and this CD has ruined them!  But when it comes to children who are too young to understand that it is just a song and doesn't mean what they say is ok... I think it is the WORST thing you could buy for your child

The sixties was a horrible decade of rock music. I would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties, which one of them is Neil Young's "Down By The River".

If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately

He was at his best when he sang about the loneliness, perseverance and dreams of ordinary people.  In "Sandra" for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour.  The combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique.  In the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions.  He released a few inspired tracks now and then, his first Christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth, and "Here at the Mayflower" was a sincere effort. He is an intelligent person who cares for music and doesn't let his superstardom go to his head.

Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original.

It's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer. Yeah, maybe my fish can get a record deal: They "sing" in tone, can breath, but refue to lip-synch(I know it sounds gay). This is just sad because bands that PLAY THEIR OWN INSTRUMENTS, WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS, and PERFORM THEIR OWN SONGS can pretty much get almost no attention. Let's take the band King's X: Doug Pinnick (vocals/bass) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about God (King's X is a Christian band); Ty Tabor (guitar/vocals) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably don't know; and Jerry Gaskill (drums/vocals) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns...yet only like a few dozen people (I know a lot more people than that like KX; I'm just exagerating) seem to like this band. It's sad. If you want good music, listen to the band I just menioned (King's X if you weren't paying attention).

A prime example of "When Gangsta Rap Goes Wrong"
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the Mid Nineties G-Funk heyday. Warren G. didn't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before. The skits are ridiculous, the music is halfass, and the lyrics are amateur. There is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener's attention for a whole album. This is similar to other West Coast rap albums that play it too safe such as W.C. and the Madd Circle's debut and Coolio's "It Takes A Thief". One star for the hit single "Summertime in the L.B.C.".

I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before "Under The Bridge" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.

Even as a joke, this would be horrible; however, I think this band take it seriously - and it blows!  I picked up this CD because I heard A.R.E. were like a combination of suicide, front 242, and iron maiden: Interesting.  NO!!  A.R.E. are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down Liars at best.  The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse.   Example: "Hey World" begins with how much it sucks to be 13.

I bought this cd because I figured it would be a fresh take on some old favoirites. Well, I'd like to say I loved it, but I didnt. This cd just comes off as flat and lifeless. Where as the original songs, the Kyle Toucher on vocals versions, had a certain edge, the remakes make great material sound very mediocre. For those of you first discovering Dr. Know,l this may be the greatest cd in the world...the material is that good-but, if you really want to experience Dr. Know, buy their Best of CD that was released on Mystic Records. This is the best version of Dr. Know. Hope this helps

The "drummer" (more like "The Anti-Drummer") on this is Johnny Cresci.  He is maddeningly lacking in even basic garage band ability, and literally has no idea what a 6/8 blues meter is.  How he landed on the same stage with these legends may be the musical mystery of all time.  For me, Mr. "Clueless" Cresci makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances going on despite his anti-rhythmic upchucking.....kinda like driving an Aston Martin with a flat tire!  I have tried to get beyond Cresci's chops for over a year of listening now, and I simply can't do it.  If you're a musician, his playing will make you extremely agitated.  I'm gonna have to trade this in, and go on listening to Live Adventures like I have for the past 37 years.  This would have been much better with the drum tracks totally muted on the 6/8 numbers.

The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: &quot;paper or plastic?&quot

This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally.  It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music.  The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.  This is worship manipulation at it's best.  If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance.  They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.  God IS great, but WHY?  This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship.

I never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but I love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are American country music songs. Can't say I'm much of a fan of American country music so was just a bit disappointed. I think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the CD.

A friend of mine turned me on to Spoon, and at first I listened enthusicatically... but then I got bored. Although Spoon's songs may be catchy at times, they are empty and deviod of any alterations. The same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so, but in the end I don't think I've ever listened to an entire track. If this is 5 star music today, our culture is severely lacking depth

Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.

Apart from the great selection of soundtracks, what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing. Executed with finesse, these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited, fuller versions: like "Singing In The Rain", for example. Throw in the great price, and this double disc set is a "must have" for all lovers of classic movie music

I bought this album because I am so into Sigur Ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews I read say that "...if you like Sigur Ros you will like MBV.." Let me say this album is no where near a Sigur Ros experience. If  I could compare them to anyone it would be very early Cocteau Twins , though I must be clear I don't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of Elizabeth Fraser.

The most overrated rapper of all time
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Simply put, Jay-Z is incredibly overrated.  I own a couple of his CDs but to be honest, I never really liked him.  His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song again.  He mostly raps about drugs, money and cars.  Nothing special, nothing new. I'm just being real about it, since everyone else is on his d!ck.  I think the reason he's so respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time.

Nestor Keeps Wasting His Talent
</Text>

<text>

As long as artists keep making albums with only one good song, people will keep getting them for free in internet.  Nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop, pop, commercial, elevator music.  If you like that kind of music, buy this CD, otherwise buy Hubert Laws, or Dave Valentin among others.  If you want to listen to good Nestor music, buy "Morning Ride", "Dance Of The Phoenix", "Talk To Me", "Mi Alma Latina" or the charanga album " Mis Canciones Primeras".  Sorry Nestor, I am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff.  When do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album

I can understand that Robin felt a need to include some of the biggest Bee Gees hits to appease the fans, but the ones that were sung by Barry are below wretched here.  Robin frequently disappears in the sound mix, becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony.  That's fine for a group concert, like the Bee Gees, but inexcusable for a solo effort.  His stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act.  They should have kept this in the can.  It seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for Robin. Don't do him the favor

What they said was that Katy can't rock just yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme.  I saw her live on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair and the Cardigans and Charlotte Martin and Rose was the worst performer of the night.  The first problem is that her voice just isn't that strong, secondly, her lyrics never come out as if they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say.  Throughout her set, there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was "Snowflake."  It's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft.  I'm sure she has potential for the future, but I think on her next album she should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop.  Stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out, and I think that could be helpful for her to put on record

Axis of Crap
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Wow!  Tom Morello, Flea, Pete Yorn, Chris Cornell, Brad Wilk, Maynard James Keenan.  When I first heard of this superstar line-up, I was sure that this CD was going to be awesome.  I was duped like everyone else who bought this album.  Axis of Justice (or so cleverly put by a previous reviewer as "Axis of Jackasses") is really a bad album, even for a bunch of political liberal rockers.  Serj and Tom really dropped the ball with this one. What could've been a festoon of awesomeness turned out to crap-fest of whiny musicians with an equally crappy message.  Knowledge, The Night Watchmen, and Ahmed Ahmed are among the many reasons why this is so bad and incredibly difficult to listen to.  The song,"Jeffrey, Are You Listenng?" is up there with other crappy songs like John Mayer's "City Love" and Richard Harris' "MaCarthur Park."  On top of all that, the communist entertainer known as Michael Moore adds his little nugget of wisdom on the DVD, which I can say I've become dumber now that I've listened to it.  For the love of all good music, stay far away from this CD

can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music?  ive listened to many bob dylan albums, and every one is a gem.  freewheelin' is my favorite, but so what?  it doesn't matter which ones we love, because we all know what bob dylan's worst record was, and its saved.  im not one to question this man's beliefs or anything like that, bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe, but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is?  could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith?  almost certainly not.  but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain

MEANDERING AND UNFOCUSED
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is an endurance test. As in 'bitches brew''live evil''love at the Fillmore' latter day Miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium. It makes 'jack johnson' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise. Take 'yesternow' it takes for ever for Billy Cobham to find a beat. This is just self indulgence of the worse kind, a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers. Miles seems to want to create 'moods' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music. This album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period. McGaughlin's guitar though breathtaking in the Mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs, totally without any structure and fire (this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with Miles) Disjointed would be too kind a word. When you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were (i dread to even contemplate). Miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo's and is embarassingly weak. Maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant, but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess

This is the album when Ja officially became a b*tch. His first 2 albums was good, I enjoyed them both and those are highly recommended. I hated this s*it from start to finish. This is a waste of space in the cd case. How can you be a murderer and a singer at the same time? Now I don't mind too much about redoing a song about or with a dead rapper, BUT YOU SHOULD'VE AT LEAST KNEW HIM MUTHAF***ER! Another disembowelment to one of Pac's classics. I stopped listenin' to Ja because he made a big change. Not cause of 50. Unlike some turncoat fans.

Two Great Songs
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones.

people this is easy listening at it's easiest. Every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years, that is if it isn't allready. I don't know anything about what they have done in the past, except for a song I remember being played on the radio a few years ago. Must have been on the album prior to this. But that song sounds just like two tracks on this one. Not only that but if there wasn't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests I couldn't really tell any of them apart. Horrible music with no feeling or soul, not even creative. don't waste your time with this.

I never could understand why the Beatles are so popular? They are pretty boring too just like Pink Floyd. Each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds. I just dont like it because it sucks! Dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below. The Beatles only made one good album and that's the one which contains Ballad Of John And Yoko, Hey Jude.

This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice

I found a supposedly "New remastered edition" of Sade's "Diamond Life" on sale for less than 10 bucks. OOPS! Great mistake! When I tried to return it, the CD store was already out of business, and the copy is one issued in the Netherlands which is marked INTO THE BOOKLET as "2000 Digital Remastered Version". The whole album HAS BEEN RE-RECORDED with new arrangements! The digital sound is quite good, but the new arrangements made for 'Smooth Operator' REALLY SUCKS!!

...when you're gearing up for suicide. This whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it, but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me nervous, numb and hurt my head.

I got this CD because I loved their radio hits "Bring Me To Life" and "My Immortal." While those songs are beautiful, they are not representative of the rest of the album. Although I tried and tried to get into this CD, the hard rock teen goth style just isn't my cup of tea, and the lyrics are too depressing. If you are a fan of bands such as Linkin Park or Seether, you might enjoy this. However, if you only like "My Immortal" and "Bring Me To Life" because of Amy's powerful vocals, you'd be better off listening to Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan.

But I mean THE MEASURE OF A MAN IS NOT HOW MANY GIRLS YOU SLEPT WITH. I mean that is how you lose money on child support. Sex has never been the most important thing in life.

This is the only album I own of Joe Strummer minus The Clash. I can't say it's very good. I hate having to compare it with it with his work with The Clash but it's inevitable. His lyrics aren't as great, edgy or provocative. There isn't any fantastic music either. I am not really sure what to say since I haven't listened to the album in so long because it was so bad, I truly tried my hardest to like it. But I feel it is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake. Believe me: I absolutely love everything about The Clash, the lyrics, Joe's voice, the music, the attitude and how cool they were, this is not Joe at his best, it's cool though cause now he's gone: go buy some Bob Marley albums instead, Joe would not have minded

This album isn't not very good at all.  There are about four songs I like.  First off, the production on this CD is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats.  Then, the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically.  Then, there are no new verses from Biggie, on the album.  They should have stopped with Born Again, because album will be a forgotten one, not a great way to close out the legecy of Bigge Smalls

For starters I love Bun B and Pimp C and UGK and all that but the thing that kills it is Lil Jon yelling "gansta grizzel" like 10 times in every track. I love lil Jon too, but they coulda done without it. also they just rappin over other peps beats, it just sounds like a mixed tape kinda deal. but heard rumor that bun b is bout to come out with an offical bun b record, not a mixed tape, or nothin like that, but only reason why i gave it two stars is just cuz they got tight flows on the tracks, but not their own beats, and lil jon coulda just shut the hell up on those tracks. just keepin it real. i wouldnt spend the money, id just wait for bun b to release his own offical cd, or till pimp c get out and ugk hooks it back up

Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.

<Text>
Etta never fails to deliver in the vocals. Gutteral bombast, sweet soul, gospel, blues, the lady is a living legend. But this album, like the last album "produced" by her son, is a nightmare. Chessy arrangments, tinkly bass, poor sound all around. She is a fierce mother and I'm sure she thinks her kids know best, but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer. Should Etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck, she wouldn't need the novelty of some of the song choices.

Only one great song on this album
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
or in their entire career for that matter.  I have tried to like this band, but Greg Dulli just won't shut up.  Every song is his snide lyrical diatribing, on and on and on.  The guitarist keeps things mildly interesting, but on this album in particular, the drummer also won't shut up and play a straight beat for once.  It's like three guys in their own worlds, and they mash it together and call what they've done songs.  EXCEPT for the one decent song they did, the only rock song I can think of that is hard, psychedelic, passionate, powerful, and set to a waltz beat of all things.  "LEt me lie to you" is the best song they ever made, BECAUSE everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song's framework and tempo.  Instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do, everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses, and it's less muddled and better orchestrated for it.  IT's a shame they didn't do any other songs like this, at least none that I have heard.  I tried to like them, I really did.  I wanted to find the band that made that one song, and discover a whole treasure chest of dark, passionate, noisy music like that.  Too bad, no wonder they drifted apart

In the past, I used to distance myself from certain rock genres because of a bad first experience. I'd be introduced to band, not like it, and claim the entire genre as being 'not for me'. The Forecast, however, has changed how I feel. I, personally, love a heartfelt emo record just as much as the next guy, but only because I was introduced to Jimmy Eat World and Spitalfield a couple of years back. Those bands allowed me to embrace the entire genre as a whole, and expand my emo knowledge. Imagine though, if you will, that I was new to emo. You, in theory, hand me a copy of "late night conversations" and tell me to listen. Of course, I hate it, and lose any interest I may have had in the genre. To make a long story short, the only good that came out of 'late night conversations' (an underproduced, generic, stale piece of s**t) was the revelation that came post-listen. Never judge an entire genre by the first or second band you're introduced to (from said entire genre). Not every metal band is Iron Maden. Not every punk-pop band is blink 182. Not every nu-metal band is linkin park. Not every 'emo' band is jimmy eat world. Every aspect of music has it's ups and downs, and the forecast is clearly one of the downs.

What a shame
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
Beautiful voice, but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd.  I was offended just reading every name on this cd...It is really a shame, what  pretty "vulgar" voice.  If this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears.  You should be ashamed of yourself as an artist, as you have such power, but it is spent on prepetuating hate.  Nina Simone was a angry artist also, but not once did she offend me (caucasian male) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america.  The first song I ever heard of hers "Mississippi Goddam" made me cry, so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice.  There will always be a "racist america" because people are selfish, but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist.  I liked the cd until I heard the lyrics, one less sale adds up after awhile

Minimal variation on the Stone Roses
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The people who have mentioned Aphex Twin and Four Tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists. If you liked the Stone Roses you will like this. It's not an 'electronic' album at all. I've ordered Manitoba's earlier cd after listening to the samples (the reason for purchasing both these albums) and I certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'Up in Flames'. It's funny, I promised myself I would never buy an album again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on the net can be misleading, either that or Dan Snaith has had a serious identity crisis in the last few years

I love The Who, a big part of my youth, probably in my DNA, but let's not kid ourselves: This is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand.

Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.

King Holiday info

In answer to a music fan from Temple Hills, the song was called King Holiday by the King Dream Chorus &amp; Holiday Crew. It came out on Mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned. It made no.30 on the R&amp;B Charts but didn't crossover pop. The lyrics are on the net (try Google) but I don't know if the song still is

G-Unit at its worst
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
of every band/group, there is always the weak link, Tony Yayo proves that he is the one with Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon.  Many of the songs are not produced by Dr. Dre (one of the few things that G-Unit has going for them) resulting in "greasy" and bad beats.  Tony Yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing, being locked up in prison, hoes, ect.  He lyrics aren't all that great either, making him have the worst voice in G-unit as well.  He sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up.  The few pluses on the album are "Drama Setter" feat. Eminem and Obie Trice followed by Eminem's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats (even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake) as well as "G-S**t".  My advice, download these two songs- this CD isn't worth $14.00

it sounds like someone somehow got the deftones to suck worse than they already do. this album isn't nearly as musically interesting as tear from the red. i don't mind the singers new approach to vocals, but it just sounded like they didn't try at all. all the songs sound the same, the tempo is too fast on almost all the songs for the screamo sound, and hearing random voices and sounds of them in the studio between recordings just makes the album drag. although they've goten much tighter as a band and aren't as sloppy as they used to be, (they fell out of sync a lot in the opposite of december) this album was definitely a backwards step in their progression as real musicians. save your money and buy tear from the red instead

Not her best...
</Text>
</title>
<text>

I've seen and heard Sheryl live when she's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs.  She's great - she's hip, self-assured and kicks butt!  But here, she tells the audience in "Leaving Las Vegas":  "I'm playing Central Park tonight... but I have some friends coming up so can you be patient...Please? For lil' ol' me? Be very patient...." almost begging the audience not to walk out while she's singing solo.  It's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the "friends" arrive.  The irony is that Sheryl solo is the best part of the album.   With the others on board, we can't see what Sheryl can do, and those familiar with her know that Sheryl is capable of a lot.   She's overwhelmed by Keith Richard, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Chrissie Hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature.  Her songs "It Don't Hurt" and "There Goes the Neighborhood" stand out on the album showing that Sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her "friends." Too bad she didn't include "Am I Getting Through" -- the Part 2 of that was a great rock moment.  Natalie Maines' grating voice (like fingernails on a chalkboard) completely ruin "Strong Enough."  Chrissie sounds like a zombie on "If It Makes You Happy", Sarah McLaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her Lilith-Fair mode that she adds nothing to "A Difficult Kind"...in fact, by the end of the song Sarah seems to disappear from the song as Sheryl belts it to the end.  That's Sheryl's song and should remain so,  Tombstone Blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of "All I Wanna Do" is the New York audience.  Happy, White Room and Gold Dust Woman are three classic rock standards, so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70's FM AOR radio has heard them ad nauseaum.  Problem here is that nothing new is added to them, they sound like karaoke versions.  Despite Sheryl's plea for patience, I was bored with the old-timers.They didn't bring Sheryl's career forward, only backwards

I own this set, as does my roomate, and we both hate it. It highlights bands like 'red lorry, yellow lorry' that no one likes or listens to, and  uses great classic bands like Bauhaus' worst song as the first track. It is  the hollow, tin-y, embarrassingly hokey side of goth, and i am ashamed to  even have it in my house

I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but "ain't no way" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't "make" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!!

First album to get an average score as low as 2 stars
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Generally on Amazon.com, the average rating of an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is, the albums are usually highly overrated. This is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve. As a result of this, generally, albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums. Ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album. Average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album. As I mentioned before, due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums, the average score rarely falls below 3 stars. It takes a pretty horrendous album, like Limp Bizkit's Results May Vary, to get a score of even 2.5. In fact, I didn't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is, until I saw this pile of feces.

There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. "Songs of Judy Garland" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what "look" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of "makeover". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to "Liza Minnelli" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't

I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime

Okay, I will admit to liking Poor Tom, Bonzo's whatever (it sure beats Moby Dick!) and Wearing and Tearing, but other than that this is a collection of outtakes that should've stayed outtakes. Low points include We're Gonna Groove, the live I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album. If you're obsessed with the band, I guess this would be good for you. But the best version of Coda is in the aforementioned $100 boxed set.

This Might Not Be the Album You Want

I purchased this album because I am a fan of the Last Poets.  Upon listening to the samples provided by Amazon.com, I thought I was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats.  However, when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like "Get Out of the Ghetto Blues."  If more of the tracks had the sound of the title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion.  True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album, but not in the form I had hoped for.  I would take the Last Poets' album "This Is Madness" over this particular Scott-Heron album

Let's get one thing straight - Radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles.  That said, this is not the album for that reason.  Do not let this album turn you off from Radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about.  There is one hint though in where Radiohead will go.  In the song "Creep", which is not a fantastic song, there is a brilliant "CHU-CHUNK" made by Johnny Greenwood.   SO PLEASE - IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO RADIOHEAD...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  For the "rockers" - get THE BENDS, for people trying to expand their musical mind - get OK COMPUTER, and if you like that you may become obsessed with KID A.  There are some unbelievable songs on AMNESIAC, but it is not their most cohesive album, and HAIL TO THE THEIF is very solid.  Thank you for your time

Boo-Wop? haha ok, anyways I bought his through Middle-Piller distro. and it's got a couple of o.k. songs on it. The problem is the singing and the overall production.

Apparently not,so mister monster gets to pull a Blitzkid (who changed their first album cover years after it came out!) and take the cheezy way out. A definete step up from bands like Blitzkid,but still in the cellar of rock n roll. Do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years

I like Jennifer Lopez, but I am not a fan of J.LO...let me explain. Jennifer started her career in the mid 90s, did some promising work (Selena / Out of Sight / The Cell / Blood and Wine / etc.), and a very well done debut album for an actor (On the 6). Everything was genuinely promising. UNFORTUNATELY, once "J.LO" was born (circa 2001), her endeavours got weak, too commercial for the sake of money, too fixed only to hype her up, not all that original nor different than anyone else, to truly stand out. "Rebirth" is an example of that. When I heard Get Right for the first time, I loved it, I thought it was catchy. It harkened the days of On the 6..that sassy, groovy, R-n-B vibe she had. Then I caught Step into my world, the only real R-n-B track on the album and thought, I'm feelin' it, definitely a favorite to this day. The the rest came along (3-11) and I thought, Sony & J.LO made this for the sake of money, due to her films doing poorly, hence she had time off to commit to recording a new album. I thought it was a very obviously fake attempt to compensate. I think she is a great performer, a very talented person, but I honestly don't feel this album makes her an artist, merely a reworking of herself musically.

Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original.

Their basically what would happen if you took P.O.D's lyrics, and then added boring 1 chord riffs repeated throughout the whole song followed by the singer screaming the top of his head off about God and self-loathing in a noise-bleed inducing pre-pubescent girl voice, so you have a band so bad it makes God himself want to commit suicide. The song titles are also annoyingly bad, obviously made so they sound artistically genius (but instead monotonous).

...when you're gearing up for suicide. This whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it, but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me nervous, numb and hurt my head.

I won't go into a long diatribe. Suffice it to say that when I listened to this upon its release earlier this year, I was disappointed. I gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great. This is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit. There's a point where baez messes up a song. (i don't have anything against baez. that being said, i don't have much FOR her either.) There's joking and laughing, but really, I don't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he'd rather be in the audience than performing. You can almost sense WHY dylan went electric in this concert.

So I think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try J-Kwon, but the game aint for you. I think this album is garbage

This album is one of the only live albums that I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness

History has a way of making the radical seem conservative, and certainly within the context of Cecil Taylor's music, his debut album, "Jazz Advance" is rather conservative.  Taylor, known for his relentless, dense music, did not emerge fully formed (although even at this early date, his music is far removed from his hard bop contemporaries), but developed over time.  For those of us who enjoy Taylor's music, this record is a historical curiosity, for anyone else, its either going to sound as one permutation further from the early Ornette Coleman idiom (indeed, this music is far closer to Coleman's sound than anything Taylor would be doing in the '60s or later).  My understanding is that when this was first released, it raised quite a stir.  Its a bit difficult to see why.

A Bitter Pill to Swallow
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Following 2002's self-produced and underrated Under Rug Swept, Morissette returns in 2004 with So-Called Chaos. With this release, Morissette has done a complete makeover of her look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour like she's aspiring to take Hollywood by strom but isn't 100% sure. Maybe the new look and image might have worked if Morissette's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but it's not. This CD starts out good with the opening cut "Eight Easy Steps," a fast-paced rockin' tune with Alanis at the wheel of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same moment. "Out is Through" follows and also stands out, but then So-Called Chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge. And Morissette should never have brought John Shanks or Tim Thorney(or both)on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks. "Doth I Protest Too Much" is without a doubt the worst song Alanis has ever recorded. The title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes overshadowed by Morissette's lyrics(yes, not her best work)when she refers to heartburn, headaches, and breached contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle. The tracks continue with "All of Me," and "This Grudge," both rather dull, while the closing track "Everything" was a weak choice for the first single. Morissette has always been a progressive artist, but So-Called Chaos doesn't measure up to any of its predecessors, and may leave many fans longing to see the girl with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks firmly in place.

This is the cheesiest music ever. Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Chaka Khan? Are you kidding me? These were the worst artists of the 80's. Where's U2, REM, the Pixies, X, the Pretenders, Tom Petty, Prince, Springsteen, the Replacements, Husker Du? Does anyone like Rock and Roll? Phil Collins writes songs for Disney and Pixar now! What did Glenn Frey know about 'Smugglers Blues'? Do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart? These are the worst artists, songwriters and performers of the 80's.  Enjoy the nostalgia, but the art which is song is seriously missing on this CD.

I was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s. Unfortunately, instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music, what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated, with some Latin tones now and then. The only semi retro/electro tracks on here (and my favorites) are Feel For You, Love Bite, Your Love is Like a Drug, and Marc Almond's remix of Venus. The two lead singles "Move in My Direction" and "Look on the Floor" are not even the strongest tracks! And the remixes on their singles don't make them much better.

I hate saying this as a HUGE Good Charlotte fan but their new album is just a major waste of money. Their first album is one of my top five albums of all time, but this one sucks. The songs are all dance pop synthesized junk. No real guitars, no messages to any of the songs, no nothing. I dont know if Joel is just too busy running around town with Nicole Richie or what but they skipped out on this album. The only redeaming song is The River, on which they colaberated with M Shadows and Synester Gates of Avenged Sevenfold. I hate hate hate to say it but dont waste your money or time on this one, just listen to the first album and remember what a great band they used to be.

This album is a real let down and it pains me to say so, since I really do like the KOL. The first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked. I didn't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling. It didn't matter because the songs were great.But on this cd they've opted for an experimental sound that doesn't measure up. Innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in Charmer-what the heck is up with that? How often do you want to listen to it? Once was enough for me. I wasn't expecting the Pixies here. And then there's the reverb employed on song after song-why? It just degenerates into white noise. There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black Thumbnail, for one. But then there are throwaway tunes like Camaro, which is about as clique as you can get. That said, art is subjective, and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. But I find most of it unlistenable.I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating; this is definitely not one of them

I was so disappointed with this CD.  At least 6 of the songs were recorded from VERY OLD albums....scratches and all!  They were SO bad. I play two of the songs over and over...the only two I liked. When I read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs, I assumed that they meant doubles of the same song....I was wrong. I don't know WHY they had to add the scratchy music..a filler?  I would quickly skip to another song...only to have to "skip" many times!

I bought this in a haze of holiday optimism, having heard Ms. Aguilera knock my socks off dueting with Tony Bennett on a television tribute show.  There is no denying that the girl can sing.  Unfortunately, what she sings here is banal at best, and downright irritating at worst--lots of gratuitous squealing.  It's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity.  I reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Then again, maybe it's just not there for me to get

Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums

All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Norah's angelic voice, otherwise I'd have to give this one a 1 star rating

I bought this CD after having seen Ken Burns' special on PBS. The energy that came through on screen in the Benny Goodman segments doesn't really come through in this CD. Artie Shaw said that Benny Goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability. That shows in this collection. Afterall, where would Jazz be if Jazz musicians didn't take risks

I LOVED Shedaisy's first album The Whole Shebang.  And I also really enjoy their Christmas albumn.  They have beautiful voices and I love the three part harmonies they come up with.  I was very excited to get their newest album but I was sure dissapointed.  This is a very dark and depressing album.  Almost every song is about lost love.  Also, all the songs but 1 are slow.  Where is the upbeat Shedaisy I fell in love with???  I would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to The Whole Shebang again.  Still, I look forward to what the future may bring from them.  These sisters have alot of talent

Most of these songs were previously sold on other albums from Martina. What a waste of money to buy this album of Mostly "old" songs and only a few new ones! Martina is sucking money out of the pockets of hard-working individuals. Maybe she should try getting a REAL job instead of using the average working person to support her lavish & luxurious lifestyle. Many of us are living in trailer parks & working 80 hours a week while Martina sitting on her a** in her million dollar house making money like rain! You, the people who are buying her albums are making her rich...what the hell is wrong with you people? Don't buy her albums and let her get a freakin' job so she can feel what it's like to work every day and actually earn a damn dollar! Martina, quit using poor people to accommodate your ridiculously high lifestyle

Though these are the songs that make the Mills Brothers famous, they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous, and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals (certainly they are considerably older).  These are OK, but they lack the punch and familiarity (to a fan like myself) of the originals.  The title, though not actually misleading, leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs--they are not.  I recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills Brothers records

When the preview aired, I was pushing the movie to all my friends, based on the hilarity of the preview. At that time, I skeptically said, "I hope these don't turn out to be the only funny parts." and that was exactly what happened. The rest of the movie was full over overdone gross jokes, crass humor that went way over the line and kept running. The pee joke was funny once, but even at that one time they overdid it, then overdid it again, and then again. The Harry Potter parts were hilarious! Jack Sparrow was awesome! But I wished I had not been forced to watch the rest of the crap just to see a few funny parts of the movie. It's another Scary Movie (1) deal, only worse! I love the newest Scary Movies, they are funny, but 1 really sucked. It was funny now and then, but a lot of it was stupid. So is Epic Movie, only worse. Don't waste your money buying it. Rent and fast forward.

First off that has to be the worst rhyme I've ever heard in my life...  Andre Nickatina (in the rapping world) is one of the worst i've ever heard, but if you're into dope beats and his style in flowing with them (reminds me of someone on the ocean just being carried by waves, paddling every which way to stay with them), and what i mean by that is he tries to keep up with the pace and the beat and says (what feels like) every single thing that pops into his head from coke to what he had for dinner that night.  But overall, "if you can't dig it like its shovelled man i guess you ain't able" summs this and the rest of the Nickatina c.d.s up

Carlos Mencia is one edgy comedian; I know this because he won't stop telling everyone about it. I've never been a huge fan of Carlos and after listening to this CD my opinion of him hasn't really changed. He claims to be an edgy comedian and that's his problem, if he was truly edgy he wouldn't have to constantly remind us in his CD/DVD titles, his show on Comedy Central, radio/TV interviews and most importantly during his own act. Sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo subjects but so does Chris Rock, George Lopez, David Cross, George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor (RIP) and countless other comedians and they are much better at it. In fact they are so good at it Mr. Mencia often feels to need to use some of these comedian's jokes in his own act, a true sign of respect for those who came before them; at least that's what Carlos seems to think or maybe he's just plagiarizing because he's not funny enough to come up with descent material. Needless to say I was not laughing while listening to this CD and it wasn't because I find Carlos to mean spirited, or crass, or politically incorrect; it's because everything he talks about that's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy has already been said by other people who are much more funny then he is. There is so much good stand up comedy out there people don't waste your time and money on this joke stealing, self aggrandizing hack.

I was really excited when I received Tone Poems III as a gift. Wow, Grisman and Brozman! Two amazing fret men playing some wonderful vintage instruments. I couldn't wait to hear some excellent acoustic bluesy slide and Reso music. Unfortunately, this recording comes across like sugar poured on the tongue. If you like sitting around in beach wear and listening to Hawaiian strumming-which is at least half of it-this is the recording for you. (In fairness, track 15, "Style O Blues," and track 20, "New Steal," are wonderful. They have some drive and get-up-and-go.)

Of the dozen tracks featured here, chances are the typical listener will only recognize four: &quot;Signs,&quot; &quot;Sweet City Woman,&quot; &quot;One Fine Morning&quot; and &quot;Gimme Dat Ding&quot; - and the last-named is out of sequence, having come out more than a year before the others.  The star of this show is Lighthouse's &quot;One Fine Morning,&quot; and Rhino must be praised for offering up the full (LP) version rather than the 45-rpm edit, which was about two minutes shorter.  It's a shame, in a way, that this song had lyrics; had it been an instrumental, it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on &quot;Music From NFL Films&quot; - it had that quality about it.  As for the other eight offerings: If they wanted to pick some obscure stuff, why didn't they go all the way and throw in Dusk's &quot;Treat Me Like A Good Piece Of Candy?&quot

Disappointing to see a man of Garbarek's gifts drift inexorably towards artistic middle-age and the lure of MOR classical and soft world-beat markets. No one expects him to do a 'jazz' album nowadays but after a six-year recording hiatus we might have expected some innovation and sharpness in the settings he chooses. Sadly,the evidence on this release is of an artist who's content to mine the same musical territory for about 15 years now to the point of exhaustion; theres nothing here he hasn't said better on his previous three or four outings. All is not lost though, and there are moments of stark beauty here and there but they are mostly lost in a soft sticky morass of Garbarek cliches and the kind of uninspired composition better suited to a film soundtrack or TV documentary about some beautiful natural environment. Forget the misleading hype elsewhere and get hold of just about any of his albums from about 1972 through to 1987 and I guarantee you'll feel better for it

this is no SAW 85-92 as some people compare it to. Oh, no. This is a largely unfulfilling listen. The tracks all sound too similar. I realize Richard's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear, but the drum programming and harmonic "development" is lackluster. Only track worth burping over is the last one... XMD something. Has he been taking piano lessons since Druqks? For those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch, check out Nick Forte's new release "young man's disease" which is better than anything else i've heard this year.

The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.

let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with "natives"?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive "guesting" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer.

If he could have found an excuse to land a helicopter on the stage, I'm sure he wouldn't have hesitated.  Mr. Banks has been turned into a one dimensional clown and his songs have all been changed for the worst. And the omission of "Sister Suffragettes" smacks of PC nonsense

Unfortunately I was EXTREMELY unhappy after listening to the album. Unlike many other Altan fans, I view Maireads singing as the weakest part of the groups appeal despite their having chosen some excellent songs over the course of their recording career. The problem is that on this album they emphasize her singing to the almost total exclusion of their  instrumentals which was what attracted me to the group in the first place. And the few instrumentals they do play are played with no spirit almost like &quot;well I guess we have to put a few instrumentals on&quot; kind of effort. I'm sorry, but she has a thin voice and is frequently shrill and off-key on many of their songs. She is however an excellent fiddler and that with the superb abilities of the other members and  inspired arrangements made them for me the top Irish folk group. Alas they have decided to stress her poor-to-mediocre vocals instead of their great abilities in playing reels, jigs, etc. I miss Frankie Kennedy's flute too. Goodbye Altan, your best day's are over unless you revert to the format of the old days

In general I'm a big fan of movie music, but to tell the truth I expected more from this one. This soundtrack is incomaparable to say Lord of the Rings or Star Wars movie music. It lacks depth and emotion and power. Unlike emotionally potent melodies present in LOTR soundtrack the Eragon is pretty dull and uninteresting. I get the impression that the entire album is in fact a variation of a single theme called Eragon. I get the feeling that entire album has only one very long and boring track. I hope they'll make better album for the next movie of the Inheritence Trilogy.

I know, I know - I never thought it possible either, that Gwen Stefani could produce something more awful than anything her (ex?) band No Doubt and reduced to house-husband Gavin Rosdale's band Bush ever could combined. Take No Doubt's attempts at reggae, their use of guitars and trumpets (together? Never good), take.. well, every Bush song ever recorded and "Hollaback Girl" is STILL a hundred times worse. Let's talk about WHY.

I heard this song on the radio the first time many months ago (and then for months and months it's been played nonstop).  I instantly hated it from the horrendous beat to the fact that Gwen Stefani is a 35 year old dressed up as a cheerleader with pom-poms and about 95% of the song is spent on the chorus "I ain't no hollaback girl" or "This s*** is bananas" section.  Pharell is a master producer and I chuckled because I thought that even the Neptunes can produce an occasional flop.  To my horror this song became the number one single for multiple weeks and became the most successful single of the entire summer (maybe even the entire year).  I don't see what people like about this song but apparently there is something I'm missing.  Like I said you either hate it or love it

i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan.  i'm a huge pet sounds fan, but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from "the left banke" to "beulah."  this album is not that good, people.  it's not even "okay."  there are way better takes on the "brian wilson" (read: phil spector) sound.  whether it's "the ladybug transistor" or "the apples in stereo."  heck, check out a great vancouver band called "ashley park" as well. the production on this is so rooted in the eighties/nineties that it's almost unlistenable.  they may be good road musicians but it doesn't show on this album, especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops "a la stone roses."  you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label's recordings or even merge stuff.  to be honest, i didn't even find the compositions that scintillating, regardless of the production.  chord and change-wise, they're interesting....but that doesn't make the songs good.

Bits of Beatles,Zappa, Queen, (Herman's Hermits ?), may be laudable  in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator.

Has the creepy competence of a Dave Grusin album. If you like that you'll be OK here

I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. This is all a bit samey and dull. I would say saved by this lady's fine voice though

The beats are nice, I would not in any way compare it to Buddha Bar.. I just wasn't as thrilled as I thought that I would be. It sounded very cheap. No originality. My fiancee is from Paris, and this was very disappointing- not only to him- but I was embarrassed as offering it as a present....So far, it sits on the shelf..

I was, overall, disappointed by this CD.  There are many good reviews here, but they generally overpraise.  Tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears.  A major highlight is track 9, The Crab and the Egret, but interestingly, the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous Chinese percussion.  Disappointingly, the CD is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment

I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT ALL! That was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album. All the songs are much too similar, the guy's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B., for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near that, either

AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber.

pure proof that the 90's are greatly missed

i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90's. this band was one of them. while yes, they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy, they still had enough bad@ss in them to put on a rad song.  i think they should have just did a "da hui" single with "the noose" and maybe "cant get my head around you" on it. this sucks really bad. it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album!! if you must hear, download or borrow.

As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy.  The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!!

I bought this based on reviews of "Bass Queen in the Mix."  To me it sounds like the West Coast edition of Northern Exposure without the 4/4 house beat.  In other words, its very electronic sounding, almost completely non-vocal and not very funky at all.  I listened to "Eargasm" by Plump DJ's and Icey's "Funky Breaks" after this and it's definitely missing variety, skill in mixing and that "neck snapping" funky quality that make the Plumps and Icey so indispensible.  Not too bad but not that interesting either.  I prefer her "Mixtress" and still have not heard "Bass Queen..."  BTW, my speakers are flat down to below 30 hz and I didn't find the recording quality or the bass that impressive.  Listen to Crystal Method's "PHD" or "Block Rockin' Beats" by Chemical Brothers after this to see what I mean

What Is The Sound Of One Oar Flopping?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks.  Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars.  Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....!  Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people.

This band sounds like a even more flaccid Killswitch Engage, a Hawthorne Heights/Silverstein with downtuned guitars. As if it wasnt an abomination already, they even sing about vampires. Yes, thats right, vampires.

EVEN A MARK KNOPFLER CD WITHOUT DIRE STRAITS IS BETTER THAN THIS! LIKE I SAID, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO THE BEATLES OR ZEPPELIN DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD MUSIC IS ABOUT, HUH!!! GOOD MUSIC IS REQUIRED DIRE STRAITS, GREEN DAY, FOREIGNER, GNR, METALLICA, AND NIRVANA. GET ANY ALBUM FROM THOSE BANDS INSTED.

The Dictators are incredible. Few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock 'n' roll ideals as these guys have, and their Spinal-Tap-meets-Ramones-mees-Beach-Boys style almost always works - almost. "Manifest Destiny" is a dissapointing release from the 'Tators. I mean its not a bad album, but the guys can do much better than this. There are a few good songs. "Disease" is hilarious, particulary the spoken word act from Handsome Dick at the begining. "Science Gone Too Far" is one of the band's catchiest tunes, proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s. Their closing cover of the Stooges' "Search & Destroy" is an okay interperatation of the classic. However, that's about it. The rest are mostly humorless FM-style rockers, and while the Dictators weren't selling out, they were certainly trying to become more accesible. Download those three tunes, and pick up every other album by the band

Brians tired of rockabilly?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have to admit, I expected a lot more from Mr Setzer. The first track was ok, then it proceeded to go down hill from there. Not much rockabilly happening, then it all comes clear with "Really Rockabilly" when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans...world wide. He even gives us Aussies a serv, even though I don't think he has ever set foot here. If Brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing, jazz, rock or whatever, then go ahead, but why slag your old fans?. It's the last time I buy one of his CDs without listening to it first

After really enjoying the Amici Forever album, I went shopping for another Amici album and found this one.  There really is no comparison between the two.  I've tried listening to it several times to see if I'm missing something, but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the Lawrence Welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe. I was very disappointed

Hammerfall is one of the bigger names out there in the power metal world, and this cd sounds pretty much like the previous 5 albums. The only dofference is that they have gotten worse. I write this review to the two groups of people out there: The exisiting Hammerfall fans, and those trying them out for the first time. For already existing Hammerfall fans such as myslef, I strongly urge that you do not buy this cd, unless it goes below 3-4 dollars on amazon. For those looking to try Hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first time, go ahead and get this one, because Hammerfall are by no means bad musicians. They can all play very well, but this cd lacks refinement and creativity. Start here and work your way up to the better Hammerfall, which you will no doubt appreciate more. Hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over and over, if you know what I mean. All of their songs sound relatively similar, but this cd marks one of the lowerest points in their career

Young Jeezy even proclaims not to be a rapper; yet, he is a motivational speaker.  So, in this case, he is trying to speak to the youth of hip-hop culture that selling drugs and carrying guns is the cool thing to do.  He should just consider himself a rapper; that way, when he's using grade-school rhyme patterns to get his message across, we can just call him a bad rapper instead of a bad role model.

Is this the same Kool Keith that created Dr. Octagon, Dr. Dooom, and Black Elvis?  &quot;Spankmaster&quot; represents a regression of creative energy.

With the exception of a couple songs (&quot;jewelry shine&quot; and &quot;Blackula&quot;), this album stinks

As others have noted, this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in Spanish sung by Maria Del Rey, plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep), plus the whole thing repeated in English.  In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary.  Don't waste your money...I'm planning on giving my copy away if I can figure out someone I know who could actually use it

Damon Che is Don Cab?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Don Caballero have always had members leave, but this is ridiculous.  Che is not Don Cab even if he is an amazing drummer and started the band.  Ian Williams for one is a huge reason for the Don Caballero sound that I always gravitated towards and without him the band is incomplete.  Why Che decided on naming this new group under the Don Caballero name rather than Speaking Canaries or something else baffles me.  More importantly, the music is BORING on this album.  It's like the new members only influences were Yes and ELP sans vocals.  In other words, no spontaneity, hardly and time changes or dynamics and weak predictible guitar/bass lines.  Avoid this album like the plague and pick up any of the Battles EPs or better yet get the real Don Cab works like Singles Breaking Up or What Burns.  There is a ton of other great instrumental bands old and new in this type of vein that blow this "new" Don Caballero to pieces

Hoping For The Magic of The First Album; Got The Mediocrity Of The Second

Outside of 'Curious' sung by Tina Cousins, this album is a dud -- at least by 'Believe' standards. Most songs sound similar with the same beat. The album won't make your ears bleed, but the band should have quit calling itself '4 Strings' after the departure of Vanessa. It is a very different band now, and should not tease 'Believe' fans into thinking another 4 Strings album of simliar quality and vocals is being released. I would buy 'Curious' if it can be purchased separately, but would skip buying this album. If a future reviewer knows where Vanessa ended up, please let me know. The mixers of the group are talented, but Vanessa was the real star

after reading glowing reviews of the DBTs I picked up three of their cds. While some of the lyrics are strong, the songs have no melodies whatsoever. Most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer. They're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of Skynyrd and the Allmans. But those bands weren't just loud guitars...they had memorable tunes and great singers. DBTs are a huge letdown

It's a free country
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am a BR5-49 aficionado from the early days at Robert's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks.  Admittedly, I long for those days as much as I long for stirrups in Major League Baseball.  So I'm nostalgic, "IT'S A FREE COUNTRY."  It is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels.  Yet, whenever I read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has "matured," I can do nothing but cringe.  Here's the flowchart:  Band starts out - Band plays hard - Band gets cult following - Band gets reputation - Band strikes out on road - Band gets contract - Band gets a little more pub. - Band gets contract with bigger label - Band gets new management supplied by label - Band gets "coached" in next recording - Band changes faces along the way - Band changes label again - Band gets new direction from new label - Band fights for identity - Band produces new "mature" album - Band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process.

I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux.  Everything after that is garbage.  This album is no exception.  Every song sounds the same and is very predictable.  The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses?  He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money.  He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented.  I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless.  1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again

I'm a big fan of "The Boss", but for the life of me, can't fathom why he is unable to follow the lead of larger acts, and actually "unplug" for MTV Unplugged.  This CD offers no new material that can't be found elsewhere, and is basically nothing more than a "live in concert" CD that just so happened to be filmed by MTV.

Blige beat, which will send you to nowheresville.

You'll find better works out there, particularly if you're a Miles fan.   The emphasis here is on Milt Jackson and his vibraphone, which gives the  album a light, airy feeling.  Missing is much of Miles' horn and sentiment.   You also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music.  I would  call this a &quot;pleasant&quot; album, which in my jazz-world is not a  happy thing

Coltrane desacrated

</title>

<Text>
John Coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine. Wynton and the LCJO are in effect the death of creative musicians like Coltrane, or most of the truly creative Jazz scene for that matter. Wynton is establishing himself as "the face of Jazz". A market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making Jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music. By telling us (and make no mistake, these guys do...): "this is what Jazz is" and trying to re-appropriate themselves the music of Jazz giants such as John Coltrane who, if he were alive, would not be given the time of day by these folks, Wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music.

A  Rather  Ordinary  if  Pleasant  Greatest  Hits
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This CD was a Big Seller upon it's release in 1992, boasting a Plethora of Big Hits, along with some New Songs.  Looking back through 2005 Eyelids, it's hard to hear why these songs were so Huge....The CD starts off well, with Hits from the Primitive Love Album, but as One keeps listening, He realizes that None of these songs have Passion or Depth, a few catchy Melodies and Pleasant, if Plain Vocals.  The Dance Numbers at least keep You awake, but the Years 1988-92 found Estefan leaning on Ballads, and One was barely distinguishable from another; on top of that, the 4 New Cuts feel like padding, to fill a CD's worth of material for a Christmastime Release...a Couple of Hits are missing, too(i.e., Bad Boys), so to summarize, Nothing truly Bad here, but precious little on Target...

Most people seem to like the soundtrack from"Glory",but this fact does not necessarily make"Glory"a great,or even good soundtrack...Most people also like the food served atMacdonald's,but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers...It is something to put in one's mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry...The same might be said regarding"Glory"...If one's tastes run to choir music,almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here...As for the themes,they are commonplace variations,often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer,or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores,so,all in all,the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap,"homestyle"diner...The film,on the other hand,was well done,and,apparently,from reading many of the other reviews here,the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself,rather than very much stand-alone praise for the score.Horner has written a lot of really,really beautiful and original scores,but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness...So,in sum,we are left with a very popular film,provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer

While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings.  I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word.  When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read.  I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words.  He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely.  I think I'll stick to R&B

After chancing upon Galactic's rather remarkable live show at a local bar, I jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc. Wasn't worth the effort, I'm afraid. Velveeta on Wonder Bread-dull collection of acid jazz  duds. Not bad as background noise for your next dinner party, but captures  exactly none of the blood and soul that make Galactic such a great live  act. A pass for all but Galactic completeists, if such an animal exists

Okay, here is the major problem with this release: it is not a TuffGong/Island release. The Marley family has struggled with this reality for a long time. Because Bob's music has become so widespread and lacks the legal protections that American and European recording artists have enjoyed for decades, his recordings have gone onto the cheap market (flea markets, push carts, gas stations, etc-and now Amazon). Buying One Love only serves to strengthen these sleazy record companies and hurts reggae artists and the Jamaican economy. Look closely at the albums before you buy them. Find out what label has produced them and try to stick with TuffGong when possible.

"Go On and Cry" - Tracks are missing!!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I'm sure glad I did not purchase this cd.  Back in the 1980's I had very little knowledge about O'Bryan Burnnette, but now that I am 22 and appreciate old school music a whole lot more, I know they made several mistakes while releasing this compilation.  "Soul Trains A Comin" (although not a chart hit) was missing.  I would perfer the original version than the 12 inch version used for Soul Train from seasons 13-"Maria" (a lackluster lp track from his latest lp, Surrender) should have been replaced with the beautiful "Together Always" (from his proper sophmore lp, You & I).  The horrible and silly "Drivin' Force" (also from Surrender) should have been out!  "Lovelite", "You & I" and "I'm Freaky" lp versions should have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood out very well!!  "Is This For Real," Right From The Start," and "Love Has Found Its Way." were the other great ballads and jams that were non-singles but were gems as well.  The absense of "Soul Trains A Comin'(original)", "Together Always", and full versions of "You & I", "I'm Freaky", and "Lovelite" really knocked off 3 points from Best of O'Bryan cd and should be made into a redo!!  For those that wasted thier money on this, "go on and cry" because Right Stuff Records done ripped y'all off!!  This underated talented artist (good singer, writer, producer, and instrumentalist) was trying to be the next Prince and Michael Jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of Carl Thomas (too soulful for the mainstream).

I agree with the other negative review below- Uninspired, simply forgettable radio trash.  Cliched lyrics?  Check.  Muddy, simple riffs?  Check.  Boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks?  Check.

When the Airplane kept it tight as in 'white rabbit' 'somebody to love' they were a force to be reckoned with, but when they got ideas above their station as in this live album there musical weakness really showed. Now i happen to think that Jack Cassidy just about saves the band with that bass, but even he can't stop the monotony of 'bear melt' and 'rock me baby' surely the worst version i've ever heard and this is all down to JOrma Kaukonen's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing. The guy maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his interminably uninspired lead work at a Hot Tuna gig. Anyone who saw the clip in Woodstock will know what i mean..No wonder Hendrix's set was so eagerly awaited!Occasionally the band get it together and Balin and Slick's vocals mesh together brilliant, but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio versions are far more immediate. Face it when it comes down to it very few West Coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights of say Cream or Ten years after. As i said Casady is per usual on form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the kick that could push the jams into another gear. It's better than 'thirty seconds' but then again anything is. If you think that 'happy trails' and 'live dead' are musical highpoints than this will complete the set, but i just think its sleep inducing

I just purchased my sacd player and picked up Boston and Billy Joel's the Stranger at the same time.  After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped.  Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction.  Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own.  I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version

Camera Obscura is similar, in an inferior manner, to Nico, of the Velvet Underground & Nico.  The band makes pleasantly dull "chamber pop" in the vein of Belle & Sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years.  Even their name is ripped off of Nico's last studio album, Camera Obscura.  But, as I said before, Camera Obscura is much worse than Nico.  If you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like, pick up "Chelsea Girl," Nico's first solo album

Someone suggested I listen to this because I was, at the time, into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call "creatively aggresive" music.  Then it was death metal (which I prefer without cursing or filth, you understand.)  Since then I've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore.

Whilst Leo Kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and John Fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers, Robbie Basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs. That this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by Kottke or Fahey (or Peter Lang) is puzzling to say the least. But, credit where credit's due: it's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant

It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality. Also glad to here that she will be making a country CD next, it will fit her voice well.

First they started out as nu-metal, then they moved onto metalcore, and now psuedo-death metal. It should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends, and after each trend dies, they just move on to another one. If my calculations are correct, expect a psuedo-black metal release.

Most other reviewers listed here believe that this CD is good - I wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary Mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier Mannheim CD's have made it difficult to critique a Mannheim offering!  I am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular CD sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music, just with different chords.  In fact, if I was not paying specific attention, I couldn't tell when one song ended and another started!  I enjoyed what I heard, but I was certainly expecting more from this CD - many of these Disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least, some variety seems to have been called for.  Disney has always included great music with their movies, running the gamut of musical styles such as classical, jazz, blues, and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high.  I do, however, highly recommend Mannheim CD's in general - just not this one

My copy of "Reckless Nights..." (and yours, too, probably) has a sticker on front that reads: "One of the Most Influential Musicians of the 20th Century."  Well, I'm so glad that Columbia cleared that up.  Otherwise, I'd have had to make up my OWN mind, and apparently music labels don't allow that nowadays.  I hope similar stickers are included on Chopin, Mozart, and Bach CDs (with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis).

I do not understand why people are so waxing poetic about this album.  There is nothing new or 'fresh' or 'original' or at all thought-brovoking about this music, unless you happen to be easily pleased by any simple pseudo-pop sound.  I have only recently discovered the world of no-wave music, but I was introduced to it through artists like Arab on Radar and Scissor Girls.  So when I tried out my first Sonic Youth album, I was way more than dissapointed.  I don't know how this can be classified as no-wave anymore.  Sure they show some trait in a few wailing off key guitars and an occasioinal shouted spoken word, but they are all only half-assed and are muddled up in cliche indie pop love tunes that have only been done in every other band.  The most notable anything is the catchy medlody of Becuz.  It is really catchy, yet it managaes to be unique enough to rise above the typical "catchy tunes" ethos.  Xiu Xiu's "Knife Play" would probably be considered more of a pop/no-wave sound that does not sacrifice the aggressive anti-music drive of no-wave... AND still retain the emotional pop sinsibility.  I don't know.. All I know is that Wasing Machine is a letdown.  It does not reach me artistically by a long shot.  Emotionally, I can think of am million other artists (Mars Volta, Emerson Lake & Palmer, cLOUDDEAD, Ulver, Edvard Greig!) who can put me on a much higher cloud and help me get in touch with the human condition.  This however is far to cheezy, and I don't know, but I think it reeks of that shallow indie fashion clique..

This recording is not great company.  I'm really confused: is it a Broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording?  And if so, did this rubbish actually make it to the Broadway stage?  I feel for the people that saw it, and were expecting the rich full melodies that Sondheim produced for this show.  The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show.  So the only advice I give to future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show: If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it!  Some things are just perfect the way they are.  Don't buy this CD.  I did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use

<Text>
First Bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician. It seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary. Here's what chaps my hide the most. Bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch. It burns me too no end when a person calls himself a &quot;jazz&quot; guitarist, but doesn't really have any chops. I know Bill has been called anti-technique, but what does that really mean? Would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well, but really isn't very good at what he/she does? This guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time I turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face. I've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years. When I have guys that actually debate me that Bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say Pat Martino, or that Bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like Pat Martino, I have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like Pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that Frisell couldn't imagine. Is Bill Frisell a Jazz musician, No! Maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he'd come up with something. For me I'll stick with the guys that really know how to play......Johnny Smith, Peter Leitch, Jim Hall, Pat Martino, Kenny Burrell, Billy Bauer, Tal Farlow, Lenny Breau, Jimmy Bruno, Jimmy Raney, Wes Montgomery and so on

There's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame, mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the "In the Zone" album: Imagine "Breathe on Me", "Touch of My Hand" or "Shadow" on constant radio play or running on MTV. And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury.

<Text>
Released by Atlantic five years after it appeared in Australia, presumably to meet high demand for AC/DC's music, this international version of "DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP" is a farce. Once again, somebody had the rather strange ideas of altering the song sequence, and replacing both "R.I.P. (rock in peace)" and "Jailbreak", two of the strongest numbers in the album's Aussie version, with T.N.T.'s "Rocker" and "Love at first feel", an OK, if not spectacular song. Ah, and "Problem child", already featured in Atlantic's version of "Let there be rock", is also included in here. The same song in two different "official albums". Marvelous!. Oh yeah, and somebody hired HIPGNOSIS in order to re-design the front and back covers. That was a cute detail, but the Aussie version's covers (classic mid 70's cartoonish artwork) are far more appealing.

Like my title line to this review states, it's the exact same music she has always sang, just in a different package. Now the CD just collects dust. What a shame

The only reason I rated 2 (1 1/2 to be accualy) is because of ViVi's Theme at the end.  This is not whorth your time.  Get the imported CD's they have much better music on them

The problem with America was that started out great.  The first album was fresh and different from everything.  Three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own.  "Horse with no name" and "SandMan", was what pave the way for them.  The problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop. They should of left "Muskrat Love." to the Captain and Tennille.

I'm sorry to vent on the Stylistics, certainly others are guilty of this, but $33 to get all the Stylistics hits is WAY too expensive.  Sorry, love the Stylistics, and the Spinners too (whose double CD anthology is around $30 too).  Why is something like Lionel Richie and the Commodores 2CD Gold $13.99?  Oh well... I'll wait

As a peripheral BNL fan, I have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out.  With previous releases, I have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings.  This cd got stale fast.  Seems to be geared to the tween crowd.  I am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the BNL I have enjoyed in years past

Hey folks, this is brilliant and all, like the articles say, but what they don't mention is that it's impossible to listen to. There are no verses, choruses, or even beats to speak of. There are no songs. It's just a sound collage or something, from start to finish. The booklet prints lyrics but I couldn't find 'em. This music is too brilliant for its own good. And you can forget about using it as party or background music. JDub's other offerings are much better

I love this show!  That said, I do not care for this version of it.  The inclusion of the word "concept" in the title means it is just that.  This was, thankfully, not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song, "One Night In Bangkok".

My 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this CD for Christmas.  It is advertised as the Cheetah Girls 2 - however these vocals are not sung by the original Cheetah Girls who are in the movie.  The songs just don't sound the same.  It's very dissappointing that Disney doesn't tell you this on the CD

Just be sure to read up on this closely... it's not the orchestra you hear in the movie, and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents Enya and Annie Lennox, replaced by no-name voices.  This is not BAD music, but don't think you're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-CD set

Closer to the Main Street Singers than to the Dubliners or the Clancy Bros
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is a saccharine and banal take on Irish music, with all the emotional intesity of a Hummel figuraine.  Upon first listen, I remarked to my wife that they sounded more like Peter, Paul, and Mary than the Dubliners. She correctly pointed out that Peter, Paul, and Mary were actually much better than this pablum, and that the Irish Rovers more closely resemble the fictional Main Street Singers from a Mighty Wind.

I love running to the Marine Corps Cadence CDs.  Volumes 1 and 2 are very good.  Volume 3 sounds studio produced and more choral.  When running vols 1 & 2 are better synched for continuous running.  The transitions on vol 3 feel out of synch to me.  Others don't seem to agree and I still run to this CD;  I'd buy 1 and 2 first if you don't have them

I first heard the song on the radio en route to work. I enjoyed it immensely and wanted to know who did the remake.  No Doubt's redo of the 80's hit brought back good memories of the new wave era. But, of course, it does not compare to the original Talk Talk version

Over Hyped CD, But Still Solid
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Paul Brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music. However, content on his latest project, "White Sand" isn't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums. The artist collaborations on "White Sand" make it tempting to purchase, but you quickly realize Brown's musical wittiness and versatility (Smooth, Latin or R&B) are lacking. Overall it is still a CD worth paying for

Harrison B-Sides!     Moon This!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Get off the drugs, guys. Your reviews made me purchase this awful load of tripe. While proficient enough on the instruments and vocals, The Moon falls woefully short just about everywhere else. The songs sound very similar to one another and are all pretty much void of any decent melodies or even a good hook or two. Right when it seems they might be getting somewhere, they break the rhythm and make a feeble attempt to psych it up or out with a sitar, swirling strings or the ever constant and really abused minor key chord changes. There is also a curious lack of any decent choruses, here. I have to believe that that was a conscious effort on the part of The Moon. Bad idea, guys. And while the music is pretty lame, the lyrics are absolutely wretched. Can anyone out there, after listening to this, remember more than ten words from any song on this washed out CD? If you can, it's because they're so lame and uninspiring. The lyrics from The Temptations' "Psychadelic Shack" captures the feeling of the sixties better than anything these blotterheads came up with.

I was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as Rhapsody (name changed due to copyright issues) on their 2006 live album Live in Canada. I have to say that I am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort. The group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music. The vocals tend to be oversung, or drowned out by the chaos in the background. Rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements, Rhapsody of Fire puts you to sleep with them. The group does stay true to their fantasy themes however

Imagine buying this CD after seeing "The Mirror has Two Faces" fully expecting the SOUNDTRACK music to the movie, and reading overall great reviews on Amazon.  Imagine the shock of receiving the CD and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - The remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse. Perhaps Barbara, with her tremendous unlimited wealth, felt she would be giving away a "free album" to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film. Shameless misrepresentation

&quot;Modern&quot; usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the Cars, Flock of Seagulls, or somesuch.  It is not a punk record, mostly midtempo pop.  The three songs Diggle wrote and sings on are  basically awful; Shelley's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics  and great hooks.  I would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch  Buzzcocks stuff; newbies should buy &quot;Operator's Manual&quot; or  &quot;Going Steady.&quot;  Or dig up the amazing &quot;Different Kind of  Tension&quot; from a used record store somewhere!  Also, see them live if  you have a chance

A Total Joke
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
It just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become. Nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance: Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, and now Paris Hilton? LMAO! No seriously though, I'm still totally not sure how Paris Hilton became so famous. Yes, I know she's the Hilton Hotel Heiress, but I'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention. All she did was live off her family fortune, but now thanks to that fortune, she was able to get the right contacts, to make her own record label called "heiress records" which is a sub-label of Warner Bros. After a reality show series, modeling career, A sex tape, and a couple of roles in a few movies, what did she think to herself? I think I want to be a singer now? Apparently. And thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about. "Stars are Blind" is her first single off her debut album "Paris" and let me tell you it's nothing new or original. The song has kind of a ska beat, which I really don't think much of. Her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon, and the lyrics are mediocre. Sorry Paris , but you failed miserably as a musician. Leave this profession for the people that really have the talent

Cruel Brittania
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly"

This is What you want (1983) was a terrible album from John Lydon and Martin Atkins.  After an rift between Keith Levene and John Lydon occured during the recording of the demo tracks, Atkins and Lydon ran Keith off and he quit the band.  Instead of keeping him on the finished tracks, Atkins and Lydon removed Levene and Pete Jones (the band's studio bassist) from the audio tracks and re-recorded them

Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television

Don't waste your money.  This album is cheesy, sounds like a million other pop rock songs, and is nothing compared to their earlier work.  With Donnie Van Zant and Max Carl on vocals, all I have to say is:  they need the old  lead singer back!  The guitar work is ok, but the classic .38 Special sound  has definitely been lost

Luny Tunes are turning Reggaeton into Pop

This album sounds to much like Pop music than hardcore Reggaeton. They even have that RBD boyband in this piece. A few years ago LT saved Reggaeton with their producing skills now it looks like they set out to kill the monster they created with this embarrasing album transforming a music of the streets into the music even Grandmas like and that is scary. The only reason for the two star is because the zion and the arcangel & de la ghetto songs. If you wanna hear some real Reggaeton look for producers like DJ Memo, Meka, Mambo Kings, DJ Wassie & DJ Fat this dudes are doin it right and keepin Reggaeton Calle my friend

Good Melodies, bad rhythm
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Like so many new-age artists, Ryan Farish has a great ear for melodies. Unlike most new-age artists, Ryan Farish has rhythmic problems. He likes to use the delay effect on his piano, but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing (sometimes it's one problem and sometimes it's both). I don't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album. Also, the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly

This tribute was announced almost ten years ago, and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then.  To be fair, there are some interesting additions such as the Sufjan Stevens and Brad Mehldau tracks.  And Emmylou Harris is brilliant.  But Sarah McLachlan's "Blue" has been heard before as has Prince's "A Case of You."  Earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like Steely Dan and Lindsey Buckingham.  I sure would like to have heard what they would have done.  Even more disappointing is that Joni's Hejira-Mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music, in my opinion.  As a final indignity, it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase, and hence the overall sound quality of the CD is lacking in dynamics.

Being an Osmond fan can be very frustrating at times...  This CD has nothing new to offer.  There have been several Osmond compilation CDs in the past 10 years.  What's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover?  Nothing.  I agree with the reviewer who wishes the Osmonds would put some of their old albums on CD instead of putting out hit compilation CDs all the time.  Been there.  Done that.  Bored to tears

Somehow not up to her earlier work. The instrumental accompaniment is good, but tends to dominate at the expense of Cesaria's voice and the songs don't strike me as particularly memorable. One reviewer said this was perhaps the best thing she's done. If so, I just don't see it. I was disiappointed and found myself wondering if maybe her best days are behind her. I hope not

As a huge Counting Crows fan, I thought it was kinda cool when I came across a tribute album to them...right up until the time that I listened to the cd. It is nearly impossible to get through. The best way I can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke. I rated it one star because there's no "0 star" option. If you have any intentions of buying this cd, find a website where you can preview it first, and thank me later

SO, NOW I AM IN A HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION OF PETER PAN, AND I HAPPEND TO SEE THE MARY MARTIN VERSION, AND THE MARY MARTAIN CD. I LOVED IT! THEN I REALIZED THAT 'PETER PAN' IS NOT A BAD MUSICAL AT ALL. CATHY RIGBY AND THE "CREW" WERE MAKING IT BAD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY THINK CATHY RIGBY IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD. DON'T BELIEVE THEM. SHE ISN'T. SHE SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS A STUIPED LITTLE BRAT THAT JUST WANTED TO ROT THE REST OF HIS [HER] TIME JUST SITTING IN A DARK CORNER CARVING FORKS WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, MARY MARTAIN SOUNDS ALL CHEERFUL, FUN, AND REAL. I RECCOMEND MARY MARTAIN'S VIDEO AND CD. I SAY NO MORE

I bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of George Orwell's book came out, simply because it was attached to the movie.  I'll try not to use any non-family words here, but this soundtrack sucks.  Muldowney's original score is available on CD, and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie.  As far as this soundtrack goes, though; skip it

I do not see how reviewers can rate this guy 5 stars.   His voice is so mediocre that I am suprised he manages to sell many cd's at all.   I wouldn't waste my hard earned cash on this guy.  Stick with Sinatra and get the best.  If not, and you want someone who can sing Sinatra style, then I would recommend you listen to the young Canadian, Michael Buble. In my opinion Michael Buble is a much better singer that Tyrell.  He can swing and do justice to that genre of music

A tenor very quickly on the rise, this is Villazon's second recital disc, one devoted to arias by Gounod and Massenet, all in sets of three, three for Massenet, and two for Gounod.  While still showing great promise, some concerns that were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so, in the French repertoire, in part because diction comes up so short here.

This album is a total waste of a truly great disc. Like Gipeto said to Pinocchio, &quot;stay wood!&quot

David Bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial.  This is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial.  A disco-esque record, it's remembered more fondly than it was received by Bowie fans at the time.  It has some good moments, but overall the production is just too slick and there's a dearth of imagination on it - China Girl is an old Iggy Pop song, Cat People is just a newer version of a previous single and Criminal World is a cover of a song by Metro, meaning there's a grand total of five new songs on it.

I don't have a problem with female vocalists, but in this album...it is retched.  I don't think I will ever listen to this album ever again.  Sorry!

Tony Kushner Is Poison To Jews
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Tony Kushner's liner notes are a chilling foretaste of his Jew-hatred-soaked script for the film "Munich."  A paragon of self-regard, he sneers at the historicity and compelling morality of the Jewish people's attachment through the millenia to its eternal homeland.  Rather, Kushner makes a point of elevating the moral stature of the Islamofascists who have unhesitatingly and unceasingly for a century prosecuted a campaign of genocidal slaughter against any and all Jews who sought to reclaim their stolen patrimony (through aboveboard land-purchase and settlement, prior to wars of justifiable self-defense).  Like his evil Arab idols, Kushner cannot abide the concept of a restored Jewish commonwealth, secured on a foundation of existential legitimacy, political independence, and territorial sovereignty.  Zionism, and its morally necessary outcome the State of Israel, enabled and is continuing to enable the very effloresence of Jewish culture in the US in the post-1948 and certainly post-1967 vineyards where the Klezmatics have been frolicking and where Kushner has gained his fame and fortune.  But Kushner hates the very thought of being liberated, and seeks to sow that hatred throughout world Jewry.  The Klezmatics should feel ashamed for linking themselves to this cruel purveyor of assisted suicide.

I respect everyone's opinion in here, and I've tried so hard to love this album because I love Pink Floyd and I see how everyone calls it a classic. But I just do not get it. I highly overrated album IMO. Very childlike and underdeveloped, but maybe that is its charm? I see 2 very different Pink Floyds and I have to say I never got into Syd's style. Matilda this, Lucifer that. The Gnome? come on. Astromony Domine was a classic but the rest of the album is a tough listen I'm sorry to say. I'm sure you'll say a true Floyd fan would love this album, well maybe that's true. But for me, when Waters and Gilmour were together, that is the true Floyd IMO. And their reign started with Meddle and ended with the Wall. A brilliant 6 album run (Meddle, OBC, DSOTM, WYWH, Animals, The Wall). For serious collectors, this is a must have and I'll give it 2 stars, but stay away if you expect another 'Wish you were here' purchase, pre-Gilmour can be a tough listen.

When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style

This is definitely not a bad collection, but there are so many better ones out there, that this should not be your first choice. The song Sweet Emotion has been completely destroyed on this album. the entire bass intro has been cut out, and the song starts about an entire minute into it. There really is no reason to do this, as even on the radio, they play the entire thing, as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long. The song starts at a terrible place too. It sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song, then just stuck it on the cd that way. Again, not a terrible compilation, but definitely not a good first choice

I could not wait to get this album.  I usually love to hear the new the Hypnotize Minds albums.  However after so many years groups do make mistakes.  This is a major one.  Chrome could suck his name off of a trailer hitch.  I own the original copies of every Prophet/Hypnotize relese since Mystic Styles, and this is by far the worst to emerge.  They never release a Lord Infamous solo album in 12 years (not to mention he is DJ Paul's brother...wait I just did) and now this???  What's next, a Crunchy Black album lol??  THIS IS A PERSONAL NOTE TO DJ PAUL AND JUICY J...PLEASE SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND RE-HIRE (at least) T-ROCK, GANGSTA BOO, MC MACK, AND BRIBE SOME JUDGES TO GET LORD INFAMOUS OUT OF JAIL!!!

on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert. that should have been as far as it went.  to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery.  if these are blues songs, then i am robert johnson's illegitimate son. "death letter" is good, maybe even great, but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard.  the rest is a waste of time.  the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd.  these are my first 2 reviews by the way, but all these 5-star reviews for both cd's finally got me motivated.  go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain

This album is so boring in most places.  I don't know where Keith Sweat's head was at.  It doesn't keep your attention on the second half.  Keep it Comin' was okay, but the other songs Keith produced as well as Joe Public were lousy. He was smart to include There You Go from New Jack City, but the songs before and after it are so bland, It seemed like the formula that worked for Keith Sweat's first two albums didn't work here. I fell to sleep while hearing the album's second half--how can anyone create such dull songs on here?  Sweat's trademark whining just does not blend with these songs.  If he had wanted to, he would have given these songs to Usher instead of singing them himself--they'd be better under him(Usher).  But I warn you, don't get this album--it's going to let you down

...but this album should never have been released as the "final" Queen-album. A couple of these songs should instead have been added as bonus tracks to one of those many Best of Queen-releases. "A Winters' Tale" for example. Do I know much about the background for "Made in Heaven", well perhaps not. But I know that this is known to be the last studio release. Sadly it has the sound of elevator-music all over, not that the melodies are bad, it just sounds... almost cheap actually -and most importantly to my ears (at least) this doesn't sound like my Queen. One of the most important bands in the history of music saying good-bye with "Made in heaven"? Was this really Freddie Mercurys' wish? It doesn't make much sence after the fantastic "Innuendo" released in short time before his tragic death containing the haunting ballad "These are the days of our lives". The words and the music... wow! And the music video to this song, have you seen it? To me that was the real good-bye with Freddie, and with Queen. And it has the sound of how I will remember them.

Triple H: This chick is a skank, unlike my wife Stephanie McMahon who looked good whilst carrying my first child(I just had a daughter). Shawn Michaels: Britard on the other hand is one ugly airbrushed, lying hypocrite.

Ok, I've listened to Fat Boy Slim.  That guy's stuff isn't bad, by no means main stream, but worth while.  But ... this Norman Cook - he's horrible.  It's no wonder Cook developed an alter ego.  With the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes, I couldn't believe this &quot;stuff&quot; had come from the same artist that produced Praise You.  Renegade Master is the type of track I've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper), and I have to give props for I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.  Other than that, this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market.  If this is the sound you're looking for, save a few bucks, check out your local yard sales.  So as not to be too negative, I'll say this; the printing job on the CD itself is charming.  The notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired

A conglomeration of meaningless noise

After discovering and loving the sound of Gotan Project I was shopping around for groups with a similar sound.  I stumbled along Emigrante and upon reading the other reviews written on this site about this cd, I thought I had found another gem.  Boy was I wrong.  The first track drew me in and left me spellbound, unfortunately, it was all downhill after that.  I was listening to the cd for the first time in my car and forgot it was even on.  The rest of the songs were so uninspiring, the music soon became nothing more than meaningless background noise

There are only a couple of songs I did like on this cd. I did enjoy Ice Cube and Aaliyah, but the rest of the cd left me cold. I do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them, it would have been better! I suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy.

I have followed Bruce Hornsby for over 20 years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert DVDs.  I was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other, but if you have been to  Hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh..no exception here.  I loved the DVD of some of his performances.  There are treasures here, Imagine, solo on the Piano at an awards show, the Star Spangled Banner at the World Series with Marsalis, and his performance with BB King.it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan

I don't think I will order from Amazon again, it was my first time and probably my last.

Tesla continues to lose direction
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I honestly feel that Tesla reached the end here. After "Psychotic Supper" failed to get the label support that it desparately needed the group just fell apart. With this the whole metal scene was falling away anyhow as grunge was dying off after the death of Kurt Cobain, and here was Tesla trying to make up it's mind what way to go. With the opening track "The Gate" it sounded like they were going to head back to the hair days of the 80's, but then the next song "Solution" they played like a lost and wandering band of the 90's. The rest of the songs just followed suit. The groups slogan is "No Machines", but there's also another slogan at foot here, and that's "No Music Direction", and for some bands that's possibly a workable concept as long as there's an inkling of where the bands roots are. With Tesla it's all over the board where they would score a top 10 hit with an acoustic version of the song "Signs", which is a rock song, to where they do a cover here of Joe South's "Games People Play". I feel that Tesla failed to show thier influences here, and was just trying to make a living; which is not a bad thing, but it pretty much kept them at a cult status. I pretty much had this album, but didn't listen to it at the time as I was trying to leave the secular music scene behind, and just move onto Christianity, and I know the album lurked around in my head all this time, so I felt it was time to face it; I feel that the album is below par for a group that can do some memorable songs, and to me it seems they wanted out of the label, and possibly away from each other.

Oh my goodness Rodger, oh my goodness.  Just oh my gosh, I'm just stunned.  This is the crappiest pice of crap that was ever ingested and mushed into chyme.  Yeah, you heard me, this is chyme.  Ok, let's see, let's mix bland country ballads with all kinds of awkward pop/country crossovers.... what do we get, half-baked, half-digested stuff that is for dumb teenage girls who are massively overweight.  Well, they're probably smarter than me........... I'm like as smart as a fungi.  No One Needs To Know and Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under are on the right direction out of the smelly stool sample.  Before I get too many people wanting to massively torture me with horrible utensils I'll say something nice.  Come On Over was an EXCELLENT effort, with all kinds of hooks, great production (errr, I mean it is Robert "I'm actually dead" Lang), and all kinds of fun.  Up! was even better (I'm not going to praise it too much, though, I mean, I AM an 18 year old guy...... so I already feel like I should be staring at a picture of Kevin Sorbo or something... which is not cool, I mean unless it's just hero worship, I could worship Kevin Sorbo)!  But still, we have this horrible, stinking, steaming mass of smelly wet clay-like pudding to shovel into the toilet (it's INTENDED target)...... looks like someone has bad aim

I think their creative days are over and if I see them in concert again, I hope I am not tortured with the music from this new album.

As a lover of gospel bluegrass I anticipated an enjoyable listening session with Blue Highway's latest offering. Let me first say that I am a fan of this group, which I consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom, but what I heard was bluegrass Muzak. Yes, the group's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence, and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller, but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing. Gospel music, even bluegrass Gospel, has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves. A good Gospel recording MUST have some cuts which are humorous, some serious and contemplative, some that push the envelope of orthodoxy, and most importantly it must have an element of FUN in order to keep the attention of the listeners. This disc fails in that regard containing standard old Gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards. My advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new, or buy used. Want mine

I'm a big fan of Great Big Sea and I purchase everything they release. Apparently they were trying to give this CD the "feel" of a live, medium-size venue performance. Unlike their other live DC offerings, this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro-cassette tape in some fan's front pocket. It doesn't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and I'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one.

Being a fan of Jack Johnson, I thought this one would be as good as the others.  I wasn't impressed at all.  It sounds like a few guys pickin' around in the basement.  The recording quality has very little production value.  At best, these are okay live versions of usually great songs.  This is an unnecessary piece for your Jack Johnson collection.

Lennon's dismal detour
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I'm a "compleat" Beatlemaniac, and I don't mind the political statements at all, but this is a nearly unlistenable record that I have a hard time counting as a serious musical effort or even a real album.  I would have loved it if it had been a 7" single, "Woman is the Nigger of the World," with the rest of it just words written in liner notes.  After that opening track, the remainder is a serious chore to get through.  It's almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent "Imagine" (1971) and the solid "Mind Games" (1973), but then again, John was not consistent, in part surely due to his apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star.  Love John for the genius he was, his commitment to peace, and the great music he made -- it's just that there's barely any of it on this particular record.

Knuff respect to Public Enemy, they are one of the few groups in Hip-Hop history who've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics.  With that said, this single blows.  It's trash.  The beats are trash, Chuck D and Flavor Flav don't rap, the DVD is just them hanging out in some clubs.  It's a shame, legends such as Public Enemy are far above this remedial single.  If you want to hear their best worx, go and buy Fear of a Black Planet, or It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.  You won't be dissapointed..

We read all the previous reviews and thought this disc would be a keeper. We (my husband, three kids 14, 10, and 5) tried it on a warm, spring evening in the car. One or two songs, like the Banana Splits, Speed Racer, and Scooby-Doo were fun. Most however, were harsh, and too fast for the parents and youngest guy.

This record kind of sucks, but that's okay, because it doesn't suck in the way where you think &quot;oh hell we'll never get a good album out of this guy again&quot; (like, for instance, Rod Stewart's latest garbage), because, I think, it's not really Lou's fault. The problem is Lou's trying to draw his material from somewhere else, in this case a mediocre poet. We've always been willing to overlook his (Poe's) considerable lack of talent (example:  &quot;in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore&quot;) because he's so damn charismatic. Morbidly charismatic, but charismatic nonetheless. The danger is that too many people consider his pure dumb fun to be art (which I guess makes him a lot like the Rolling Stones). Lou, who's always shown himself to be a poet but a poet with a wink, has now chosen an artist who is basically Bernie Taupin with a better vocabulary to be his kindred spirit, and from someone who, Velvet genius notwithstanding, produced revolutionary and stunning works like Transformer, Metal Machine Music, and Berlin, this self-effacing friendship is the real tragedy

I have been a NIN fan since Pretty Hate Machine. I think Trent Reznor is a brilliant musician. All of his previous albums have been absolute genius....until this? I pre-ordered this album anticipating another masterpiece. What a disappointment!! I still can't get over how terrible this album is! The only song that is worth mentioning is "You Know What You Are." That's the Trent I know! I purposely skipped the tour just so I didn't have to hear the new stuff! I hope this isn't it for him, but I will be cautious when the next album comes out

While there are some flashes of brilliance in this album, it is compromised by a lack of direction. The 'Tastes so Sweet' mix of Rapture is beautiful, although cut far too short. Faithless, Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soulsonic, and Crystal Method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album. The high point, without contest, is Darude's ripping mix of Rising Star's 'Touch Me'. This is a cut to throw on for the peak... when you find the party is just outside of Barstow with Hunter. That said, then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album. These are more appropriate in an adolescent Brit girl's drawer next to the Spice Girls. For some labels, this would be normal, for Ministry however, it is a dissapointment

This CD has some good songs on it, but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes! It's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than I expected. They are mixed together, and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started! If you don't mind really short songs, buy this, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise

I agree with "music fan" about this CD. Eden is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't terrible, but it's not very good

If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version.

Scrappy man you let us down
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
First of all let me clearly state that im from Atlanta and I am a diehard fan of Lil Scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this CD is garbage. Besides Money in the Bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with DJ Don Cannon early last year was on fire, He and Cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point, that was of course before 50's influence which brings us to our problem. The influence of Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent is very clear on this album. I like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south. If the G-Unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let Scrappy pick and choose his own tracks, verses etc. everything may have been fine. The guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the "A" is pumping this and it is a shame because when Scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable. This CD is garbage plain and simple and 50's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise's up. This is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.I have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he's dropped but, im telling you If you the consumer buy this Cd you will regret it and to Scrappy ditch the G Unit do what's in your heart and get back to business.

I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are clich idden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "Safe In New York City" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts

Do you LOVE "On Eagles Wings"? If the answer is yes, then do you know the words to Panis Angelicus? The answer is probably "no." I don't blame you for liking this CD. The problem is that it isn't Catholic and it isn't Classic. You should ask yourself if you are willing to entertain the songs that Catholics have enjoyed for thousands of years. If you are willing to look beyond the guitars at your local mass, start with Sacred Songs by Bocelli, or Simply Baroque by Yo Yo Ma

I have been listening to military band music for years, and am rarely disappointed.  However, this compendium of music by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Marine bands and associated choral groups is not to my taste.  Many of the arrangements are strange, and there is much too much vocal music when what I want to hear is the bands play.  I would not have bought this album hhad I known beforehand what I know now

I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull?

I like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style' music while I'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax.  This CD just didn't fit.  There are a few ok 'songs' but the rest of it is either too fast/upbeat or there's too much talking/chanting.  I found myself distracted when I put this CD on

Certainly this album offers very little to a fan of The Ocean Blue's eariler work.  The vocals and guitars sound quite different (gone is that beautiful dreamy sound).  And what about those awesome saxaphone and  keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun?  Just because Steve  Lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether.  So,  anyway, what does this album offer instead?  Harder sounding guitar,  angrier sounding vocals, and songs that are somewhat intersting, but are  lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after  you've had the CD for a couple weeks.  Exceptions: &quot;Whenever You're  Around&quot;, and &quot;Slide&quot; are good enough songs to standout  inspite of boring production

Paper Roses - not the original
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I was very disappointed that the version of &quot;Paper Roses&quot; included on this CD is an updated and new recorded version from 1990.  It is not the original 1973 classic Marie recorded when she was twelve.Interestingly, this new version is produced by Sonny James, the original producer of the original single, that also features many of the original studio musicians.  So all is not lost. Still, I prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this CD included an updated &quot;Paper Roses.&quot

Hmm...  Ok, maybe it was not the best reason to want to buy this CD, but I heard one of the songs on it, Hashkiveynu, performed (partially) during an episode of the West Wing, and it sounded AMAZING (it was NOT the same cantor as on this CD).  I am not Jewish and not even very spiritual, but I wanted to have that song in my collection.

Disappointing second album
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I'd like to second some of the other reviewers' reviews of this album. It really lacks the energy and the coherence of the previous album. The tracks in general are a little slower. The production quality is overall about the same, but it is just not as "listenable" as Believe was. The exception I find on the album is the "Club Mix" of "Turn It Around."

Read this review before buying ANY ultra lounge CD
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series

The versions of "Black Sabbath" and "War Pigs" actually comprise half of Black Sabbath's appearance on the April 26, 1970 edition of John Peel's 'Sunday Show.'  "Black Sabbath" features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song.  "War Pigs" is actually "Walpurgis," an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics.  Incidentally, the other two songs from that broadcast, "Fairies Wear Boots" and "Behind the Wall of Sleep," were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release.  All four of these tracks, while fascinating, don't rightfully belong on this collection, as this disc intends to highlight Ozzy Osbourne's career as a solo artist.  For that reason, the live version of "Paranoid" that appears on this set is equally unnecessary.

Lou Reed rocks!!! Dude!! But methinks this collection dost not. The tunes are all good, but there aren't very many of them, and the sound is deplorable, in that inimitable RCA-first-CD-edition sort of way (fans of the Jefferson Airplane and Harry Nilsson know what I'm talking about). A much better jumping off point would be &quot;Different Times: Lou Reed in the 70's&quot;, or, even better, check out &quot;Transformer&quot; or &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Animal&quot;

There are some artists who have been active since the 60's and 70's and who are still producing vibrant, excellent music. Paul Simon, say, or Bob Dylan. Kate Bush, though she started a little later. All of these artists have evolved past their original sound but are still great.

Hate to say it, but this is pretty drab stuff.  That said, I'm hardly about to complain; how could I?  This was obviously written for a film (that I have no interest in seeing), and Mogwai just released 'Mr. Beast', a solid (if unspectacular) album earlier this year.  I kind of see 'Zidane' as a gift, then.  Looking at the whole thing from that perspective, it's impossible to be letdown.

All three of these things are pretty much absent from this CD which ends up making it dull.   :yawn

I like AC/DC but I hate this
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!

While I doubt I'll EVER get used to the edited (single?) version of 'Nights In White Satin' presented here, I have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for a compilation of this seminal band.  That said, The Moody Blues (or more likely, their record label) haven't exactly been shy about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on CD, either.  While 'Gold' represents an affordable means of buying some of the best known and loved music from The Moody Blues, it also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as well.

My youngest brother, who has a pretty strange sense of humor, bought me this CD for my birthday; I wonder how he knew I didn't own it already? I don't even know where to begin with this one. What can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop? And the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable. Does she expect anyone to take her seriously? After her first album, I thought Carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning, particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches. Instead of getting better, though, she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices. Rappers like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott and Usher are brought in to add spice, but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing. She may have a lot of #1 hits, but who can tell any of them apart? Rainbow is only Carey's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere.

Perhaps Puffy only got as far as he could riding on Biggie's legacy, but lets face it, he really has very little talent, charisma, charm and just seems so dull, he is basically a male Paris Hilton, going around acting like the world's biggest d1ck ny saying "look people, I got money, arent I cool" besides Biggie(RIP), Bad Boy really is not great, most of the artists are poor quality, The production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial. This album is basically not even worth printing or existing. It is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like Diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on TV. I don't know why people like Tupac, Biggie, Dimebag, Chuck Shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths. So I would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and D4L deserve, a 1 star rating.

Some will mistake me for a Evidence hater, but I'm really not.  I just want the man to put some effort into what he does.  I'm tired of taking just any ol' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the "fans" don't expect very much -- or simply don't know what good is anymore.  Sure, you can relate to what Evidence is saying, but you can put on a dope instrumental CD, sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head, have a discussion about any topic, and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album.  I quickly get tired of the "slow flow" -- see: talking -- and I feel like anyone can do it.  I don't shell out money for things I can do myself.  Really, the only difference between him and 50 cent is content.  When I hear someone say "slow flow" my mind translates that into "reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on" because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came.  And lot of these beats, though very dope, are as slow as his flow is.  Couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like Joe Scudda (I'm sorry, I tried to like him, but dude is simply terrible), Big Pooh (same goes for him), and Madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener.  The only dope guest shots come from Phonte, Planet Asia, and Slug.  Yeah, I know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names, but I'm going to keep it honest -- fu** real.

In many ways a relic of its era, "Not of This Earth" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of "Time Machine", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press.

To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the &quot;songs with lyrics&quot; in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album &quot;When I Woke&quot;. Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song

I was looking to get the DVD of DAZED AND CONFUSED but got the CD. When it was advertised on the AMAZON website it led me to believe that it was a DVD as you see it above. (1993 Film) I had to return it and my expense. Very disappointing transaction with AMAZON. Threfore, i am not impressed

If you work in a comic book store, live in your mom's basement, own a lot of black candles, and think that H. P. Lovecraft wrote history books, then you might like this garbage. If you have a life, a clue, or a girlfriend, then you probably will not have any use for this stuff. I still can't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal. It belongs in a category with Sisters of Mercy or Morrisey. This record is completely lacking any imagination or energy: depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel. I guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast, this would be the thing to listen to. Personally I think it's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour. Don't give these jokers your money.

Once again, the geniuses at Universal have failed to give fans a decent collection! Although the single disc Very Best Of released in 2005 provided a fine and simplistic overview of Robert Palmer's career, it omitted a few "must have" songs in favour of live material (making for a 90% OK collection). Earlier anthologies also suffered invariably from "redo" syndrome: the artist redoing a vocal track here, a drum mix there, re-recording entire songs elsewhere. This collection's no different. In fact, there are many "remixed" and "redone" and "alternate vocal" mixes present (something the Very Best Of album avoided altogether, much to its credit). Here, insult is further added to injury with poor song sequencing. Indeed, the classic and sequenced "Sailing Shoes/Hey Julia/Sneaking Sally Through The Alley" trilogy that marked the beginning of Palmer's breakthrough album is present, but the songs have been scattered apart from one another. Thereby pondering the question: What were they thinking? Why was this done in this manner? What do fans really want? A 2 disc set that features the original material (remastered, yes, but not remixed in any way, shape or form) and a proper chronological sequence. Done in this manner, such a set would properly honour one of popdom's most memorable and talented individuals. What Gold has done showed that compilers went through a rock encyclopedia, took the right batch of songs, but mish-mashed them in a half-cobbled manner. This collection does no one any favours. Stick to Very Best Of until another bright light at Universal tries their hand at compiling a decent collection. That said, the way the music biz is these days, don't count on it.

I bought Guerolito after hearing "Heaven Hammer," the remixed version of Guero's "Missing."  That remix, by Air, is the sort of product that makes remixes valid - it takes the passion and yearning lost in the original production of "Missing" and makes it feel at home in a louder, more tempting sonic landscape.  That song became astonishing where the Guero song was simply alright, and the new song, "Clap Hands," is at least a good time.  However, it's hard to swallow the cobbled remixes on the rest of Guerolito - the beat and the original of, say, "Earthquake Weather," (here as "Terromoto Tempo") are both individually appealing enough, but together sound dismayingly like they're from different planets and belong nowhere near each other.  "E-Pro" becomes a groaning mess, the lovely "Farewell Ride" an electronic nightmare, and both those descrptions would be apt to describe the record as a whole

I remember really liking this album when it was first released, even though I could tell it was not in the same league as The Real Thing or Angel Dust. Listening to the album now, I realise it is by far the worst FNM album since Mike Patton joined. The whole album feels very rushed, it has a sparse, raw sound, very different to Angel Dust's polish. The music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like B-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums.

This CD should have been called "The Most Annoyingly Overplayed Songs of the 1990's." With the exception of "Shine," every single track on this CD is juvenile, mindless, fluff that was overplayed on the radio in the radio until you were ready to scream! If you're looking for a CD that represents the greatest music of the 1990's, check out Non Stop 90's Rock or Forever 90's instead.

This CD shocked me. At first I was listening and enjoying the beats on every track. But then listening to the actual content of each song, B*tch this and h*e that.

What kind of message is this sending to our young black men? Our young women? I would not recommend this for any one, especially anyone under the age of 16 or any woman.

The Most Tasteless/Ridiculous Remix
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The remix is totally devoid of any taste:First the vocals are completely-off;the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings. Secondly,there is absolutely no respect on part of the "mixing DJs" for the great vocalists:there  is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together' of the music with the vocals. I was deeply disappointed with this cd.If you are into remixes get The Rod Stewart "Do ya think i am sexy" single cd instead

My two parakeets seem to enjoy this CD a bit, but if you want a CD for relaxing listening, be prepared to be irritated.  I tried to go to sleep listening to it one night.

It sometimes seems they recorded it by just hitting the &quot;repeat&quot; button on a couple of bird sounds.  I think I could have done that.  I'm just glad it didn't cost a lot, but now I can see why.  Sorry for such a bad review, but I just had to tell anyone planning on buying it.

Sugar Ray and the downfall of what was once a good band
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.  I believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality

SHE SOUNDS JUST LIKE FAITH OR MARTINA.....
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Some of the songs here are good, most notably "Never Be Forgotten".....beautiful.  I heard this song on the radio and I thought it was Faith Hill or Martina McBride singing.  Herein lies the problem.  The song is good, the voice is good.  But if she sounds like Faith or Martina, there's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there.  Add to this that this is mostly bubble-gum pop and not country....there's really nothing that stands out here.  Why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there?  That's the question.

I can't believe the touch of B.B. King. I enjoy his playing immensely. I know this album gets buried in accolades. But I don't like it. The quality is poor and, differing from other's opinions, the crowd noise takes away from the music. B.B. said, in so many words, that Live at the Regal was far from his choice as his best recording. Typically, he said he wouldn't argue with success--and left it at that. There are so many good albums by B.B. You can't go wrong for $4.65 for the "Ultimate Collection". Sure it doesn't have them all--but it has quite a few of his great songs, including a few from Live at the Regal. I would steer clear of this selection. Or I'll send you mine for free

If the name Pink Floyd wasn't on this cd, who would really rate it higher that one or two stars ?  I am a Pink Floyd fan, but I have to say that I don't like any of their early works.  To me, the band begins to make great stuff with "Meddle" and their first cd were boring, even with the Pink Floyd name on it. The only good track is "Childhood's end", the other tracks are poor

Eight years ago today was the day Blondie's reunion album was released, and though it was great to see Blondie back together, No Exit just fell short on many levels. 2004's The Curse of Blondie(see my review also on Amazon)is a much better album and should have been their comeback. No Exit won't exactly take you back to the hooks that made Blondie famous. Harry's lyrics are wonderful in "Double Take," but the deadpan melody literally kills the song. Fans were also not terribly waiting for jazz standards("Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom Room") or revamped demo tracks("Out in the Streets"), but the worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by Coolio. Both the band and Coolio could have thought of something more productive to sing about. The music isn't catchy either. All is not lost with songs like "Night Wind Sent," and Harry's own transformation in "Forgive and Forget, plus who would dare argue Blondie's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear "Maria." As the album's best track, "Maria" is a wonderful reminder of how Blondie, and Debbie, can still create an infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind

There is not much I can add to these reviews here. Just like me, a lot of people here were dissapointed because of the fact that so many classic 2Pac songs were remixed only to sound like disasters. Why would such an abomination happen? Suge Knight is trying to milk the Pac legacy until it is bone dry. Well at least he has done something right if you ask me. It sucks that this is how we are forced to remember Tupac Shakur, over tracks chopped up into this. Die hard Pac fans won't even like this, if they haven't heard it already. I'm so waiting for a remix album of "The Chronic" and "Doggystyle".

If you want the original recordings, don't purchase any volume of Television's Greatest Hits.  I've had better luck recording the songs off of my TV with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my PC.  These collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The Munsters" that just don't sound right to me.  If the original recordings don't matter to you, then you may like this CD

The lady can sing, but her "Christian" message is compromised because of her part in "Chasing Papi", where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage.  It's "Crystal Clear" to me that Jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part.  It's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee, much in the same way that Stacie Orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me, or is it coincidence that these two womens' album covers look strikingly similar?  It appears their paths in life are similar, too: compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart.  As with a recent review of Orrico that I made, I'll give Jaci Velasquez her due:  she can sing, and what I mean by that is sing the roof off of a house!  This album was excellent.....was.  Now, whenever I think or hear of Jaci Velasquez, I can only think one word:  HYPOCRITE

I picked this up because a) it's Boz Scaggs, a guy whose records I wore out when they first hit, and b) it's full of great old songs.  BUT:  Boz sounds like he's doing something else, maybe surfing the internet or looking out the window, when he sings.  Hard to imagine that the man who punched out "Lido" can sound so half-asleep performing great material.  A washed-out, almost depressing performance.  There are many much better renditions of these classic songs.  I imagine it's hard to come up with new material, but please, if you're going to do these songs at least sing as if you're awake.  No emotion, no involvement.  And to add annoyance to injury, Boz somehow found the world's worst drummer for this session.  If you can tap your fork on a tabletop you can play the cymbals and traps as well as him, incessantly dopey and grindingly repetitive.  Pass on this one

I can't, for the life of me, understand the appeal, or better, the necessity for the Black Crowes. To call all the riffs recycled is to give them credit for originality they don't possess...There's nothing here that hasn't been done better, with more creativity and feeling, and of course, originality, by the Stones, Faces, et al...And it's not a valid counter-argument that the Stones stole  from the great blues masters, because, of course, they did...but what they also did is add some value, something of their own, that was completely fresh...What these guys have done is the aural equivalent of sewing a new name tag on..

I was deeply disappointed by the so-called &quot;return of the funk&quot; with the Headhunters reuniting with their original lineup. As compared to Herbie Hancock's original &quot;Headhunters&quot; release, the Return of  the Headhunters is missing one main ingredient, the grease. This recent  release has traded the &quot;grits and gravy&quot; created by the sounds of  overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers, for over-produced  smooth jazz-funk, complete with overused N'Dea Davenport R&amp;B hooks that  left this album flat

usually jerry's scores for movies are priceless,(i.e. the other score for &quot;legend&quot;)but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too&quot;forced&quot; for my taste.it's ok as a weird sort of comedy album,I suppose,but from the  main theme I was laughing because it's meant to be such a serious experience-but isn't!I think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd.(.

Great film music... but it doesn't stand up on its own

Fight Club is without a doubt the greatest film I've ever seen. Yeah, I'm a fanboy. And what? And to make a great film flow, you need great music, right? Well, you need great music that fits the film, and the Dust Brother's score more than does the trick. The film is dark yet satirical, and it needed a score that would compliment that.

Nickel Creek Origins...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I purchased this CD shortly after finding out that Nickel Creek would be disolving their union as a band.  I hoped that this collection would be suitable for both myself (as a strong supporter of Nickel Creek) and my two children.  This CD honestly fails to deliver a suitable substitution for the music that Nickel Creek produced over the past 7 years.  Although, I guess that was an unrealistic expectation to have for this CD.  You have to keep in mind that the members of Nickel Creek were just children themselves when they released this CD.  I don't believe that they had found their true musical identity, and they obviously wouldn't have reached their full musical potential yet.  This CD isn't really the best for a todler either, so I have to say that this purchase was a let down overall

I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead

Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal (&quot;Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot;) or precious (&quot;Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound&quot;); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs

The fact that this has had no US release was an immediate warning .... however as a longtime fan I figured I would check it out.  Boy is this bad.  There are a few decent tracks, however the truly awful "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "This Magic Moment", "Only You" - among many others - make this unlistenable.  Miss Ross is a great singer and interpeter - check out the delicacy she approached the Billie Holliday material.  She is a producer's singer: Ashford and Simpson, CHIC, Holland Dozier Holland - even Hall & Oates - all were able to take her talent and create - in some cases - true all time classics.  This is a mess.  Diana, your voice still sounds great - STOP executive producing your projects

Not so much a band as a corporate scam
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Like the Backstreet Boys (essentially the same band), and Brittany Spears (their female solo artist - and I use the term loosely- equivalent), NSYNC represented all that went wrong with the music world in the '90's. Sure, there have been completely commercial bands out there for ages, but at least groups like The Eagles wrote their own material and played their own instruments. Not NSYNC, who instead rely on unimaginably boring backing tracks and a stable of professional songwriters who couldn't write a decent tune to save their lives - I bet even their voices were digitally altered.

Chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again. FFTMC and BTS were lush and beautiful productions. NIcks latest attempts have been pathetic...from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint...even his older 'pop' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he's doing these days...no, we're not saying recycle the older productions, but instead it's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality' in the profuctions...a signature if you will...and hey, it doesn't have to pigeon hole you if done with class...yes, how the mighty have fallen...

This product is listed as "Limited Edition Special Packaging" at a cost of $30.99.  It's nothing but an ordinary CD in a plastic jewel case with a "Made In Hong Kong" sticker on the back.  It's the import version.  There's nothing "special" about the packaging.  Save your money and get the domestic version for $14.

It is ludicrous to even mention the fact that The Duprees have lasted so  long and can still be seen in Atlantic City considering the fact that there  is not one original member of the Duprees in the group that is seen in  Atlantic City. This is a major problem with many groups purporting to be  from the 50's and 60's. The Duprees appearing today is a perfect example of  caveat emptor ... buyer beware for those readers who don't read Latin! For  those of us who were Duprees fans, this is a not to be missed CD of the  original Duprees with the incomparable sound of Joey Vann and harmony that  is hard to match. They did Joni James proud in their remake of a number of  her hits. It is nostalgia personified hearing the original Duprees

Krall Away While There's Still Time
</Text>

<text>
<Text>
Diana Krall's popularity is not hard to understand, she's easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice - rich, round, and polished.  But that's where the good news ends.  The selection of material and the narcoleptic Bossa-Nova-on-the-rocks arrangements combine to create a CD that is nothing less than a love song to Darvon, in fact, inside industry sources maintain that the entire CD was recorded in the frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to eliminate the middle man.

I was prepared to spend the original $26.05 list price for this motion picture soundtrack. At that price it was already the most expensive out of 12 CDs ordered. I was refunded the money to "The Last Starfighter" due to an error listing. When I went to re-order, the new price is $49.95. What a joke! Someone is pocketing an incredibly high profit margin. I would love to have focussed my comments on the actual composition, but until it is sold at a fair price, I will reserve my rating

This cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this Jarrett quartet's other three releases.  It's like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what WAS a very beautiful triptych.  "Belonging," "My Song," and "Nude Ants" are all virtuoso, spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed.  But, I'd go nada on this one if I were you.

Like the other reviewer of this cd, I am also a fan of Buffalo Tom. Unfortunately this doesn't sound very similar to BT, in fact it is a bit dull.  None of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair, since I only played it 3 times, hoping it would grow on me.  I'd recommend "Up Here" instead of this one, it's much more listener friendly

man i don't know what he was thinking when he recorded some of these songs.  the musicianship is, of course, outstanding and his voice is perfect for covering lightning hopkins, furry lewis, son house (shaker lp) but who wants to hear repeated renditions of my old dog blue? i agree with other reviewers who laud "james alley blues" "richland woman" the 2 l.hopkins songs "katie mae" and "darling, do you remember me" muddy waters' "little geneva" and sonny boy williamson's " don't start me to talking." the other songs do not merit a second listening for anything other than historical interest.  the "shaker" cd is even worse.  son house's "death letter" is above average, maybe even great.  the rest is barely listenable.  if you love the blues, particularly folk blues you will be infinitely happier with any l. hopkins cd

Although a few of the tracks seem inspired, it's mainly Mulligan going through the motions with Getz, with very little chemistry between them.  &quot;Anything Goes&quot; and &quot;Scrapple From the Apple&quot; are nice  enough but beyond that it's weak.  Mulligan himself didn't speak very  highly of the recording session, saying that he enjoyed his other dates  with Desmond, Webster, and Hodges, but mentioning that &quot;Granz wanted  that session a lot more than I did.&quot;  Of course, it would be quite out  of the ordinary to hear anything but negative remarks about Stan Getz and  his sparkling personality.   Save your money and go buy the 2-disk reissue  of &quot;Meets Ben Webster&quot;.  Or, if you don't have it already, the  seminal Pacific recordings with Chet Baker

I purchased "Empty" not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable, but eventually forgettable, pop/rock.  This sophomore effort is, simply put, amatuer and sub-par.  Some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as "Empty" B-sides, while the cover of "Electric Avenue" never really distracts most listeners from thinking "What is this and why?"  Over all, this might appeal to most Christian radio listeners, but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is: mold-fitting white noise

Saved by Oingo Boingo...

I should have reviewed this along with FM. Both were double record hit soundtracks. Both represented youth. Both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing. One was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack. This is the terrible soundtrack. When the best songs are by Billy Squier and Sammy Hagar you know you're in trouble. Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, Don Henley are each awful. So were the GO-GO's. Not surprisingly Don Felder and Jimmy Buffet both sucked. I almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when Graham Nash played. The band that called themselves Poco can't be the same Poco I grew up with. There were some listenable tracks by Timothy B. Schmit, Louise Goffin and Stevie Nicks but then there's Quarterflash. However, amongst all this crap was a gem...the very last song is Goodbye Goodbye by Oingo Boingo. This song rocks and Danny Elfman sounds crazed. Unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash

La Grange is probably at the top of most ZZ Top fans lists, and rightly so as it is superb, but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track, which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording.  It is so awful that I don't know how anybody can listen to it.  Thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for Rancho Texicano.  Clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here, dummies.

I own all of Bebo Norman's CDs, and I LOVE all of them, except for this one.  I bought it and listened to it once, and I hated it.  It does not sound like Bebo.  This sounds like Steven Curtis Chapman or Michael W. Smith or any of the other mass produced Christian/pop music artists.  On all of his previous albums, even though he changed his sound slightly, it was still generally very acoustic and Bebo-ish.  This album sounds nothing like his previous music.  I was disappointed.

This young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice, albeit a little underpowered, but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture. There is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties. In fact, I suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short-shorts. Once again, sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art

I really don't want to be mean, but I find this album very shallow.  Classical Indian music is a very complex, subtle and beautiful thing.  Comibining it in this way may help to get these wonderful tabla players to a wider audience, but the true energy has been tainted and lowered to make it palatable to simple-minded people who need westernized electronic and wishy-washy "world music" cliches.  I don't find this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting.  And this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything, I have delved deep into the avante guard, minimalism, "new music", eastern and western music theory, microtonal, etc. I would recomend jsut being a non-westernized album and getting the full benefit of tabla playing.  However if your mainstay is jungle/drum&bass, then this would be a step up for you, so go for it, it is worth the pruchase in that case

this album had two good songs at the most. ralph was good with new edition. it's apparently obvious that he can't stand alone. bobby should have been the lead for new edition. then we may never have seen this terrible album. ralph isn't that good of a singer. this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group doesn't mean you are the best. ralph is miles behind bobby

This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this

The 1 star is for this 5 star CD box set being no longer available. Does anyone know why or if it will be reissued soon? I have the Highlights CD and the "Live at the Plugged Nickel" double LP - but not being able to buy this is disappointing and puzzling.

Gypsys Do Not an Experience Make
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Jimi Hendrix was an ideal guitarist to lead a power trio, and he thrived in that format.  He inspired other groups to attempt it, with varying degrees of success.  But the Experience was a unit, able to soar on stage in extended live versions of Hendrix's compositions. Had it not been for the demon of discontent within the trio itself (that curses so many otherwise excellent bands), the Experience might have created several more inspired albums than it did before falling apart.

First show on Broadway I ever left at intermission. I bought the tickets because I didn't think I could go wrong seeing a show directed by Strohman, starring Craig Bierko who was fantastic in Music Man and was flat flat flat in this show, and music by Harry Connick Jr. whom I have loved forever. It taught me that everything has it's place and Harry's place is not a Broadway stage. I hope for his sake, he does not try again. If I could rate something at zero stars, this would get that rating

I am completly shocked at how high the scores for this album are on amazon.  Trust me, I am not someone who claims to be a music expert, but I am a big fan of Jam/Funk and Jazz fusion.  I play bass, I understand music, and Umphrey's is among my favorite bands (others include 311, Widespread Panic, Deep Banana Blackout, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soulive, Medeski Martin Wood).  In general I am open to all kinds of funky music, and Umphrey's usually puts out.  In my opinion, this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk (following the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 311).  With this album I was expecting them to develop their sound from Anchor Drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like RHCP's Blood Sex Sugar Magic did, while staying true to their unique roots in Jazz, blues, rock and even some metal.  Like I said, they fuse genres like no one else can...THIS album, however, was a complete failure in the areas I have described above.

It seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them, and the Flower Kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds.  Here we have yet another double-helping of their ageless wisdom, strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment.  Though not as crass and offensive as Stolt's "Wall Street Voodoo" or Bodin's "I AM", this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness.  There are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release, but not enough to justify its purchase.

I have been a Ronstadt fan since the early 70's, and although the Nelson Riddle stage and the Mexican stage were not my style, I still loved her vocal perfection.  This is truly the only album I haven't played more than twice (I didn't like it the first time, which surprised me, so I tried it again). It doesn't showcase her voice or her talents. The songs are very ho hum.  Linda, put out a Christmas album (been waiting for years), and try to get sweetness back for this old fan

She doesn't sing... SHE YELLS!!! And using one of Ednita's songs as she did with "Lo que son las cosas" is just sacrilege at its "best" (or worst). It's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself. She has absolutely nothing on Beyonce or Cristina Aguilera. Her cd is just plain bad! If you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices (and that actually SING), you might want to look for La Lupe, Celia Cruz, Ednita Nazario and Lucecita Benitez... and these are only the ones I remembered at the moment

Not All Collaborations Are Good Ideas.....
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Firm(a conglomerate consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown and the relative unknown Nature(who took the place of original member Cormega after a heated dispute))...came up with the "brilliant idea" to collaborate on a full album...after the release of "Affirmative Action" from Nas' It Was Written album.  After enlisting the assistance of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records and production by the infamous Trackmasters,  The Firm's album is subpar to say the least...it sounds like each individual artists is trying too hard to outshine the other and many of the beats consisting on this album are just a lil too sample heavy...."Hardcore" for example.  However, I will admit, there are some shining moments by all four members....and some half decent production....i.e. "Phone Tap"..."F**k Somebody Else"(lyrics are forgettable since Foxy is doing what she does best on the mic...talking about sex and its many forms....I think you might be able to masterbate to this one...LOL).  I will give this a decent try but I can't go no further than that.  I will agree with one reviewer saying that listening to the group as solo artists is a more satisfying

This album makes you pray for him to go back to his 70's style
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I've owned this cd, but didn't keep it for very long because it's too poppy and slick for my tastes. I guess when about 1981 came around Billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70's style, and on this offering, he kind of wanted a 50's or 60's kind of sound. This stuff is just to slick for this hombre. He never made a solid album, after the release of GLASS HOUSES, in about 1980. This is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about, but if you've got some integrity, you'll probably want to steer clear of this one, and buy anything he recorded in the 70's

Derivative,  Pompous and Absurd
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought this album on the strength of positive reviews and personal charts displayed on amazon.com and amazon.co.uk. These suggested that Eloy's Silent Cries and Mighty Echoes album was redolent of Pink Floyd and Yes. Actually it is, but only both bands at their very worst. The album opens with an inept attempt at Gilmouresque doodlings circa 1973, moves on to some truly rank singing, with the singer's phrasing hardly assisted by a strong German accent and thus the suspicion that he doesn't understand the absurdity of the lyrics. Actually, at times the lyrics do remind one of Jon Anderson at his silliest, although we forgave Mr Anderson and Yes because they were superb musicians and songwriters. With Silent Cries & Mighty Echoes the tunes are pooor and for progressive rock, the song structures are of almost childlike simplicity. That this album was made in the late seventies is extraordinary in itself. It would have been appalling in 1972. To discover it was recorded in December 1978 is gob-smacking. Unforgiveable tosh

I heard from a number of people that Amon Amarth were an excellent death metal band, so with that in mind, I though I'd try OSFTGH. What I hear, and it certainly seems I'm missing out on something, is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting. Just because you have mead dripping from your beard, and you scream out lyrics that contain, no mercy, vengeance and "it's your time to die" does not mean you can create "authentic" Viking/metal. These idiots could definitely take lessons from: Enslaved, Manegarm, Falkenbach to name a few. Don't fall for the hype!

I couldn't find one song I really liked on this CD. Sia truly has a unique voice but it's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight. Still, I'm severely disappointed, particularly because I had to pay for this CD as an import

the illusion of a mature mitchell
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
i deeply love the music of joni mitchell. it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you, to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it (as i stupidly did). the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it (a new mature joni! a return to the roots! a brilliant acoustic album! and nonsense like these...) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see (well, hear) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years (except "dog eat dog" which is superb, but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it's an '80s disaster). it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening. ok, some lyrics are quite good, but nothing compares to the joni of the '60s and '70s. so, i really do not get the point: it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say (how painful it is to face reality!), so, why should all of you praise her? just because of what she did in the past? ok, let us say that she WAS the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation (according to me, much better than bob dylan) and let us praise her forever because of that; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does, even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art. i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album (and anything else from 1982 up to now - except, as i said, "dog eat dog"). if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell, try anything you want from the 60s and 70s. really, anything. try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins. you have to be prepared, for it could be beautifully dangerous: once you know her, you will never let her go away from your soul

The build ups are terrible and I felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists. Stick with "Tiesto:Nyana" ...10130340345435 times better

<Text>
I bought Kayslays Pain From the Game about a week before it came out in most stores(my local cd store likes to sell their copies ahead of schedule;).  I read that it featured production by Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Eminem and the Heatmakerz.  And as far as rappers go, most of the Shady/Aftermath camp is on here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists (fat joe, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Scarface, Memphis Bleek and Prodigy, etc).  So I expected this cd to be a big step up from the Streetsweeper Volume 1 mixtape (which I would give 3 stars at best).  But for all the talent on this cd there's not many good songs.  I thought the production was pretty weak.  Some no name guy produced most of the cd but even the kanye west, swizz beatz and eminem tracks are pretty bland.  If you have to have every song your favorite rapper or producer ever made, grab this disc.  If your looking for good music leave this one alone

As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time.  Ultra Chill series 1-4 was outstanding.  While Ultra Chill 05 is not a complete disaster, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating.  Quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs.  Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.  There is a lot of Jazz and Latin chill on these two discs, which I also like, but the Jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great.

Amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of Brahms' music. With a few exceptions the moto of this CD can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. The choice of music is also quite perfunctory. There are many Brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose. Buy at your own risk. My only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of Brahms from this CD..

There is at times, a fine line between noise and music. NIN not only crossed that line in this cd, but stomped on it a few times in the process. Not even close to the calibre of WITH TEETH, this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians.

A not-so-good album. Why? Read this...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release, I need to be honest and explain why I am giving just one poor star. No, I am not crazy. Let me explain my point-of-view, and after that you can decide if this JH album really deserves more stars. Just to start, this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band(?) or the musicians thru a solid path. There are tracks played by a duo, trio, 4tt, and sometimes a very loose quintet, and each of these tracks have a different mood, without any presence of a jazz soul, or even a real smell of jazz. Maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage/tribute to Mr Strayhorn, or maybe a recognition for Mr Henderson value in the 20th century Jazz History as one of the most important hard-boppers ever. But the result was very poor. If you really love Joe Henderson (as I appreciate), try any of his albums from the 60's (as a band-leader or as a sideman), mainly those from the Blue Note era. In time: I gave one star, in memory of his brilliant carreer. This particular album deserve zero-star.

Still Waiting....
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Almost 10 years later... and I am still waiting for the punchline.  I think this is the most properly named album of all time... as the easiest summation is:  it lacks ANY punch and keeps you waiting for something that never comes!  Its terrible, especially when contrasted with Pornograffitti.  Gone are the great guitar tone, riffing, rhythm, power, and groove that marked most of the prior three albums.  It's what the forth side to "III Sides To Every Story" could have been... "Yours, Mine, The Truth, and THE SUCK".  The songs are lackluster, but its really the guitar sound that kills this album album.  "No Respect", surprisingly, by name, is the only song worth any respect and the only song near upbeat on the album.  "Waiting for the Punchline" still remains in my top 5 worst albums of all time... I dont write negative reviews unless a CD is really bad in general or really bad compared to the bands other work.  In this case, it fits both... its bad for Extreme... and stands up as exceptionally bad among all other bands' albums as well.  Conversely, in my opinion, III Sides and Pornograffitti are 4 and 5 star albums, respectively

As others have noted, this was a time of turmoil for the group. Now trimmed back to a fourpiece (they had just lost guitarist/singer Bob Weston and singer Dave Walker), they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had either self-produced or collaborated with Martin Birch on. This CD also leans really heavily on material from Bob Welch (this would be his last release with the band) and it suffers deeply for that.

After breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group Chicago, Traitor Cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker.  It's coincidental that the first track is titled "Big Mistake", as if Traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make.  I bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money, and after I had listened to the album once, I made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly.

I cant understand how anyone can give this album more than one star.  Luckily I got this cd for free when they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on their 2005 tour.  I love classic Journey, but this band has gone downhill faster than I ever thought possible.  Most of the songs are terrible-boring music and even worse lyrics.  'Arrival' was pretty mediocre, but this is about 5 steps DOWN from there.  Granted, Steve Augeri does complete justice to the old songs in concert and really sounds great, but he obviously has nothing to offer in the way of songwriting.  The only way this band will ever create quality new music is if Perry were to stop sitting around at home and come back to the band.  Otherwise, the band should seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on tour every couple of years

I never write reviews for anything, but this one was so bad, I couldn't help myself. Everybody has different tastes, but if you like music with any kind of structure or melody at all, you will not like Belladonna. I could not make sense of it at all, it rambled on and on, never getting to the point, never picking a path, never building on a theme. It bored me with it's vague attempts to build a song. I listened to it 2 times just to make sure I wasn't imagining how bad it was, and then I dumped it. It was not my style, and I don't see how it could be anybody's style, but that's just me. I felt obligated to voice my opinion and possible save somebody out there from being bitterly disappointed. Good Luck on your listing adventures

I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie.  I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words.  Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words.  It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it

I understand why so many people like Dido..She is beautiful, has a decent voice, comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive...This album is the same - 'inoffensive'...some might say, bland...The tracks that work for me are 'Thank You' (used on Eminem's 'Stan'), but is done solo here and it works, 'Hunter' and 'Here With Me'...The rest just disappear into the background like a passing car...Nothing much happens, nothing inspires...I really want to like her, but it's all been done before..

This will be the third time I have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album, and I suppose I have been too harsh, because neither of my previous efforts have been posted. Lets keep this one simple. This is not music, plain and simple. I purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site, and was terribly disappointed. It basically consists of massively distorted (and detuned) guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence, structure, or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument. Call it performance art, experimental noise, whatever. It's simply not music.

Dan Fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer. Unfortunately, the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts, songs that seem formulaic and &quot;safe.&quot; His best songs are the lesser known works -- listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them. They'll never make it to the pop airwaves. Serious Fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd. &quot;Greatest hits&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;greatest music.&quot

It was very jazzy, which I hate. I'm going back to the Putamayo CDs

Too many birds
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
While the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded, there are way too many birds around. The CD describes their sound as distant and faint, but that's far from accurate. The parts of the CD where all you hear is the stream alone don't add up to more than 10 minutes, and never last more than a minute. For the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds, rather close and sometimes very loud.

Once "The Very Best of 10cc" was released in 1997, it was the collection to have.  That collection included 15 tracks that spanned 10cc's career, ending with the Godley and Creme hit "Cry."  So why would this CD be released, especially since the only thing it offers over the prior CD is "Channel Swimmer" and "Don't Hang Up?"  Buy the CD "How Dare You" and "The Very Best of 10cc" and you will have three times the music you have on this CD for only twice the price.  An unnecessary addition to the 10cc portfolio

This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's &quot;Stronger Than Death&quot; album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of &quot;All For You&quot; and &quot;13 Years Of Grief&quot; sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of &quot;No More Tears&quot; tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. &quot;Like A Bird&quot; is the best song Neil Young never wrote and &quot;Blood In The Well&quot; shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story

Awful. I mean, really awful...and I liked "Self Portrait" because you knew Dylan was just trying to have some fun with his image. This album is just a disaster. The lyrics are OK on most songs (I've seen worse by Dylan), but the music is unexciting, not very creative, and downright embarrassing on some tracks. Why, oh, why did you have to make an album like this, Bob? Such talented people at your disposal for these sessions, and you threw it away on garbage arrangements. Shameful. Really sad.

This CD was devoid of any of Govi's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work. Frankly, it was just a bunch of New Age background noise that one would hear on elevators.

Well it was an obvious path to musical collapse, she should have stopped at Tidal.  If I'd been dating her for the talent she showed on her first CD I would have broken up with her over this piece of haggis.  The course of the last three CD's drew a trendline right from stardom into a melodic pit.  The lyrics on Extraordinary Machine were not only not up to their namesake but worse than the melodies.  The number of great reviews on this site only go to prove once again the masses prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive.

This album was released in 1999. And now, seven years later, this album does not even matter. Britney Spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child. Great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity, innovation, creativity, and ability to transcend cultures and generations. Great music stirs something inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it. Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally. And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades, even - after their release. Music like this, Britney Spears and her peers, disappears into the folds of time. It does not matter.

When will artist realize you can't change the old classics.  The only successfull R&B group to sing the classic "Night and day" to their own beat was the Temptations CD "What women want" the best rendition I have ever heard.  Smokey does have the voice for these kinds of songs.  Another good CD with classics is Willie Nelson's Stardust

I had high hopes for this cd. I love norwegian metal, and I love viking stuff so I thought this would be great. I was at least hoping it would be good. What I heard was a bunch of uninspired, mediocre, a dime a dozen metal songs. I mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste, but not enough to give it even 3 stars. The high points are The fate of Norns, The persuit of Vikings, and Arson. These songs are bad @$$ and fun to listen too.

I am a huge fan of Thomas Newman but really this CD presents nothing new. It comes across as merely a re-hash of the airy, atmospheric, melody-free cues from his other recent scores. It has none of the originality of American Beauty or Road to Perdition. Frankly, as much as I like his scores, I don't think this warranted a CD release, it's just got too bland and ordinary, no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds. A pity

Zoolook~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best. After having made amazing albums such as Oxygene, Equinox and Magnetic Fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album. I find it a bit too much like modern art, i.e., confusing, confounding and impossible to grasp. It also seems like Jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album. He had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work. This is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album. Very disapointing indeed!

I love Milton Nascimento's early work (&quot;Travessia&quot; and  &quot;Clube Da Esquina&quot;), but this does not reach that level by far.  My main objection is that it does not live up to the promise delivered by  the famous names of the participants like Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter,  Pat Metheny a.o. &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; is OK, but the rest is just too  pretentious. Just as a warning to all Brazilian music lovers out there:  this is certainly not a must have, apart from die hard Milton fans. I would  rather recommend to check out the latest releases by fellow Brazilian  Caetano Veloso (&quot;Livro&quot; and &quot;Prenda Minha&quot;), because  they are really indispensable

The first feeble bleatings of a jazz &quot;purist&quot;

I remember when this recording came out and Wynton Marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz. I picked it up right away. I was mystified by the souless mimicry of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and Miles' 2nd great quintet--this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz? Listen as Wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements, stopping on a dime! Marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars!! Gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of Think of One that strips the tune of any semblence of swing!!! I get it, Wynton--you've mastered the trumpet, technically speaking, which is no mean feat. And you can read music. Bully for you. The only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say. Ordinarily, I'd feel sorry for you, having wasted all those hours of practice, except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you aren't worthy of washing. People like John Coltrane, Joe Zawinul, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock...I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. This music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber, thus killing it.

My wife got this CD for me because I like the music from the movie Cast Away.  She saw the words &quot;Cast Away&quot; in large and prominent print.  She saw the picture of Tom Hanks, very large.  She assumed it was the soundtrack for the movie and not just the 10th track of 10 on  the CD.  In hindsight she should have read the entire panel on the CD.  I guess the producers of this CD didn't think the rest of the music could stand on its own and so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people wouldn't waste time returning it.  If you had it listed in the rate column, I would give it a negative rating instead of just the one star

This cd is, without a doubt amazing.  Stars are lost because prior to recording, you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn NOISE GATE for his guitar rig.  His tone is crushing & sounds perfect, but the second he stops playing, every time SSSSQQQQQQUUUUEEEAAAALLLLL.  It's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once, because it is a chronic problem in every song.

How The Mighty Have Fallen  (2.5 Stars)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
When I first saw this album I thought "Heavy D....WITHOUT The Boyz?!  That can't be a good thing."  Here's the problem with this album: Heavy D took the "jiggy" route.  When I heard "Big Daddy" for the first time, I thought it was pretty tight and that it had that Heavy D feel to it.  So after hearing that, I went and copped the disc.  When I got home and read the liner notes, my jaw hit the floor.  There was Heavy D....smoking cigars, iced out, and playing the big willie role (the popular theme for the "jiggy" crowd in '97).  At that point, I realized that original MCs were quickly becoming extinct.  After years of success with his group, Heavy D had jumped the fence while simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time.  That might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least somewhat decent.  There are about three tracks on the entire album that are even worth a listen.  There's a lot of lazy and predictable production (we're talking obscene amounts of beat jacking).  On "I'll Do Anything" Heavy D and Tony Dofat COMPLETELY jacked Hall & Oates for their tune "I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)" and it only gets worse throughout the album (I won't even get into how the Gap Band's "Yearnin' For Your Love" was abused on "Keep It Comin'").  There aren't enough good songs on this album to make Heavy's change of heart seem very believable.

(it?)I have many of David and Japan's albums, but this thinly composed album is repetitive, boring and annoying. I think there were some hidden tracks too, but I just wanted the album to be over. You are better off with "Dead Bees on a Cake" , "Secrets of the Beehive" or any bee related titled album of his

As you might think, I am not a die hard fan of JMJ, I think that when only die hard fans rates an album, it makes you think that with such a high rating, everybody should love this album and this is not the thruth.

Listening to this C.D. first gave me a headache, then it made my stomache churn. It is SO uninspired, it's not even funny (or listenable). Yeah, it's loud, but I can be loud, too, if I had some pots and pans and a "guitar." Don't get this, it's nothing but d-r-i-v-e-l

If I can't buy the cd with ALL THE SONGS that were played in the movie then I won't buy it. I know one cd could cover the entire movie so why can't this be done? Does it concern copy rights and releases

I love plenty of Contemporary Country music... everything from "New Bluegrass" (Alison Krauss & Union Station) to "New Country" like Reba McEntire, Rascal Flatts, Brad Paisley, Martina... even a lot of Faith & Shania.

This is by far the WORST KMFDM RELEASE... No Esch, No Schulz, just Sascha and Skold messin around with a little Pig..   At first listen this album is not bad but once you get used to it, this album is really boring..  Dirty, Skurk, and Preach/Pervert are really the only songs worth listening to.  I was embarrased to listen to "Risen". It was just lyrically horrible I don't know what's wrong with them.  Now in Skold's defense, he is a badass, his voice is cool and he's a good writer his solo album is good.  But we had him in Symbols, Adios, MDFMK, and Attak it was just a bit much. This album is bland at times good and most times pretty bland.  Not what you think when you think KMFDM, though Urban Monkey Warfare is still cool... whatever I am one guy buty it, if you like awesome, if not sorry..

This whole post crap grunge is crap.  If you want real rock check out GNR, ACDC, and any band pre grunge.  I know this is a review but how does this grab ya. Oh and I won't mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom. &quot;Oh how did we wind up like this?&quot;  Exactly what I'm trying to figure out.  Tesla's got more talent then all these bands and they can't get any airplay give me a break

I'm not exactly sure how to classify this, nor do I think it really deserves the time.  How this album has garnered so many positive reviews is beyond me.  My only guess is that some tired, pretentious teen on MySpace raved over it and voila, the clique was born.

The singing is terrible on "Fly Me To The Moon".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings "all I worship and adore", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it.

OK - let me preface my comments by justifying the 2-star rating...It's Rodney Dangerfield - he was a class act.  As for the CD:  If you're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone's cheesy clavinova, then this CD is for you.  I bought this because of the last track, "Rappin' Rodney", and boy was I disappointed. It sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette.  Do yourself a favor - get all of Rodney's DVD's with his standup material and remember him for what he was - a comedy legend

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS COMPILATION!

I received this 2CD set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called "mastering".  I have original un-mastered copies of some REO Speedwagon albums that sound BETTER than this set!  I love REO to death and the track listing is good to go, but in all honesty, this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality.  The band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for.  I cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close.  Save your money and wait

Most of these idiot reviewers are missing the fact that this CD is missing lot of songs which define Extreme.  The implication that it is a &quot;Best of&quot; and not a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; should have included more from their self-titled album.  Tsk-tsk, this doesn't include &quot;Mutha (Don't Wanna Go to School Today)&quot;, how can that be

There's always the argument that if Bach had had a modern piano, he would have composed for it. Let's consider another possibility: if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to Bach's doorstep, he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea, since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the High Baroque composers.

To much guitar, drowns out all the other instruments.  Survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums, not guitars.  I was expecting another Burning Heart, Is this Love, High on you.  No songs on this albums have that sound.  The vocals by Jamison are top notch, but none of the songs sound like the Survivor I remember.  Survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards, bass and drums, not drive the whole song. I guess Jim Peterik was the man behind Survivor all along.  I give the CD 2 stars for Fire makes Steel, the rest are throw aways.  ***Recommended for die hards only*** I highly recommend 'When Seconds Count' for anyone getting started with Survivor

Really this is not a good album, as side two is rubbish.  I still haven't  listened to it all the way throug

When John Cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist Gary Duncan were in the groove, there was no better sounding group than QMS. Cipollina's talent was awe inspiring. Unfortunately, one of Quicksilver's overbearing and domineering members ways led to Cipollina's departure. Without Cipollina, QMS sounded like just another mediocre rock group, despite the talents of Duncan, Freiberg and Elmore. I saw them at the Hollywood Palladium 33 years ago and can verify this.If you want to hear them at their best, buy the 1st album, Happy Trails, or Lost Gold and Silver

Yes, she has a great voice, but this entire CD is so overproduced, so lifeless, so very boring that I had to force myself to listen to the entire thing - searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice. She sounds as bored as I was on every song. I hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep

Nana has a beautiful voice, but her singing is monotonous, predictable.  She lacks passion. Sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of  really interpreting the song. In addition to this, the arrangements are  unfortunately very poor. Her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra.  Only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with  candles, but this is not the album I would like to listen to again and  again

As a Gene Autry fan, particularly of his Christmas recordings, I was really looking forward to this release.  But...what a disappointment!  I will look over the dropouts - obviously the source tapes have deteriorated - but what happened to the final three cuts?  They are so laden with noise reduction artifacts that they are barely listenable.  And, I know the disc is short, but were the 2 second pauses between tracks REALLY necessary?  Talk about choppy. No flow at all.

Blues singers shouldn't try to go mainstream. If they do try and succeed, fine. That means they've stayed true to their roots. When they try and fail (as Susan has done with Hope and Desire), one would hope they'd try to get back to where they started. For me that was Just Won't Burn. I guess when one is happily married with children, it's hard to sing the blues since you're not feeling them . . . you're faking them

Gonzalo is a fantastic pianist.  This CD however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side.  However, it is languid and the tunes don't stand out.  It is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments - if driving later in the day.  I have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste.  But it is exciting.  Not here.  There is barely a hint of any Cuban influence in this music as well.  Now some will like the gentleness I suppose, but with weak material and not much diversity, it sits pretty flat with me
