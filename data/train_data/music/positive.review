Pigpen's night
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I'm just starting to become a true fan of Pigpen.  Earlier, I just didn't get him and I would constantly skip forward to more of the GD extended jams.  Lately, I've started to get what he was all about and what made him such an important part of the early dead shows.  I'm glad I picked up this set.

Rain in a CD
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
At the end of the day, when you come home from school or work, one can't say &quot;I feel great.&quot; Rather than great, we are stressed and tired. The sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this CD captures it it almost perfectly. I too, am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain; and it does work. It would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping. With quiet, natural sounds, it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you

I have been a Barry Manilow fan since I was a teenager.  I have NEVER been disappointed with any of his work and this CD is no exception!  He is such a brilliant arranger and the remix of these classics is fabulous!  His voice is as good as ever!  Even my 7 year old begs to listen to the CD everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words!

This is a Kick A** CD
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I read some of the other reviews before I submitted this.  I don't see how someone could get upset over the liner notes.  Redd doesn't include Danny Gatton as an influence because he didn't listen to him.  As far as other reviews concerning tone and the lack of fire, well, I don't even know how to address that.  Redd has one of the best tones I've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers.  Ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar?  Well, you won't get that on this CD because Redd doesn't play something to just play it.  This CD showcases Redd's versatility from country, to swing, to blues, to rock, it has it all.  If you like good pickin', then by this CD

I was already a fan of Mike and the Jacksons, But when Motown 25 came on in 83, this guy set the standard for what music and performance could be and where it could go. Till this day in my lifetime that one performance at Motown 25 is the single most perfect performance I've ever seen. I remember the next day at school and the next month after that performance we had all kind of talent shows where all of the kids were trying to out moonwalk each other. The saddest and funniest part was watching the less fortunate kids who could not afford the Michael gear wearing tube socks with dress shoes and kids making home made glitter and rhinestone gloves. Hilarious. As an adult, I refuse to let the media and even Michael himself ruin my childhood memories of this untouchable piece of music.

Zombies - 'Odessey And Oracle' (Big Beat) 4 1/2 stars
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Review no.77.A superbly/nicely done reissue of The Zombie's second 'actual' album(isn't it?).Total of 27 tracks,so since the first twelve(12)cuts were the original lp,I guess that means you get seventeen bonus tracks,wow!That's a lot,for a one-disc release.A fine CD to repeatedly play,plus keep in your 'current rotation' stack for a long time to come.It's PROBABLY just me,but these tunes SHOULD be in a different playing order.That's why I'll sometimes pre-program this CD before I listen to it.Loads of fabulous/memorable tunes to enlighten your evening with here,like "Care Of Cell 44"(three versions,but welcome),"Time Of The Season"(stereo and mono versions),the beautifully-done melodic "A Rose For Emily"(2 versions),"I Want Her,She Wants Me","Maybe After He's Gone" and a cut that I've certainly never heard before,but was quite impressed with it,"Butchers Tale".Obviously,The Zombies must've had hours of unreleased material that most of the world didn't take great notice of,until now.Simply,a must-have.Timeless top rate British Invasion rock&roll that'll never truly die

If Only You Were Lonely

Right, so by putting a review down for this album, I am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight, cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long, well too bad that's not me, I am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music. Hawthorne Heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others, I have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over, they might even sound gay at some points, although, "we are so last year" made me laugh "I should have known you better, i should blame it on the weather" wtf is that??? Anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why I'm giving this 4 and not 5. But here we're talking music not lyrics. The music has nothing very special to it and I can play every song on guitar, they often use the same chords except for a few songs "This Is Who We Are", but they have a lot of interesting melodies and don't just rely on power chords to make their music interesting. Even though these chord sequences are often re-used, Hawthorne Heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses. The other thing I have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band (behind his guitar) but also when is a good time to scream and when it isn't. This makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks. Hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness. Also check out "Where can I stab myslef in the ears" to see how hawthorne have improved. Overall this is a step forward from their last album, it won't change the emo scene forever, but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it

Swamp rock deluxe
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
With his snarling, gritty guitar tones, swampy grooves, and scratchy vocals, C.C. Adcock makes butt-shakin' music that blends rockabilly, old-school Memphis R&B, New Orleans funk, Cajun dancehall tunes, and juke-joint blues. He's young, but no poseur: Having paid dues with Bo Diddley and Buckwheat Zydeco, Adcock knows rootsy textures like the back of his hand. But despite the tremolo guitar and slapped upright bass, this isn't a retro-sounding record. Adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous. Doyle Bramhall joins Adcock on two songs, and together they raise 6-string hell. Boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of attitude, Adcock's music is soulful, somewhat twisted, and deeply satisfying

I am just writing this review to correct Alexander from Russia, who cites this album as a Christianity peddler.  Leonard Cohen is a Jew, who unlike Bob Dylan (on John Wesley Harding) embraces his sense of Jewish heritage and religion within his music.  Alexander, you've brought your own interpretation to what is a distinctly Jewish artist and his work

Hounds is an outstanding piece of work. Two outstanding pieces of work if you look at it properly. The first consisting of five individual songs, though all with a very similar feel and texture. The second is a conceptual set of songs called The Ninth Wave, which has had many meanings read into it.

We need a more complete REM greatest hits collection!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
REM has had a helluva lot of hits, and has remained a radio staple and has been a big influence on later bands.  This 18-track album does a good job for its length, but I really do feel a 2-CD hit package is warranted.  The biggest omissions are "Shiny Happy People," "It's the End of the World as We Know It," and "This One Goes Out to the One I Love."  It wouldn't surprise me if the band didn't really like these songs and would rather not include them in their greatest hits collection.  However, there are a few other more minor hits I know from them that are missing, like "Radio Free Europe."  I just can't think of other titles right now, but there are more than a few other omissions too.

I had been hearing "Always Thinking Of YOU."   But, I never got who it was.   I purchased XM radio and on the smooth jazz channel, I heard the cut again and got the artist name.  Purchased the CD based on that one cut.   Every cut is great on this cd.   I look forward to catching him live at some point and will continue to look for more from him in the future.   He has his own style.  But, not only do you hear hints of Benson and Brown..........I hear a little Doc Powell as well.   I will be introducing friends to this great artist............Keep it coming............

Chris Cornell post-Soundgarden, pre-Audioslave
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Following the demise of Soundgarden in 1997, everyone was curious what Chris Cornell would do next. Would he immerse himself in another band where he could display his blood-curdling screams or would he surprise everyone with something totally different? He chose the latter. With Natasha Shneider on keys and Alain Johannes on guitars, Cornell found the opportunity to break away from his heavily Zeppelin and Sabbath-rooted musical background, and he also asked some other musicians to make an appearance on the record.

I heard the first Beat LP (&quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band's brand of ska/soul/rock.  For some strange reason, I never bought &quot;Wha'ppen&quot; and never got familiar with it.  I confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away.  Of course, I did buy &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; and found it to be par excellent.  So I ordered &quot;Wha'ppen&quot; a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and I've been wearing it out.  Damn!  How did I miss this?  This is a great collection of snaky sweet, politically smart songs.  &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot;... I've loved that song for years... and &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot; has always been a favorite.  But every other single song on this CD, including the bonus tracks, is outstanding.  These songs are textural wonders.  Great stinging guitar work and the incredible Saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording.  I regret not discovering it sooner, but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact.  Oh yeah... one more thing... I had the pleasure of meeting Dave Wakeling in Nashville this past summer and he's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him.  If he comes to a venue near you, don't miss the show.  You'll get your money's worth and more.  Wear your dancin' shoes.  He is truly one of the great talents of the 80's and continues to make significant music.  He may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades.  Buy this CD.  You won't regret it. It sounds best in the early evening.  I'm the Big Oh and I gotta go

A PERFECT, GOLD-MINE OF A CD!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have seen Al Jarreau 20 times in concert (and recently saw Al and George perform at the Hollywood Bowl) and am a long-time fan from WAY BACK. There are a few Al CDs that you just play forwards and backwards (and back when they were cassettes, you wore out the tape) because they're just PERFECT. "Breakin' Away", "Jarreau" and "Heaven and Earth" come to mind. Well, add "Givin' It Up" to that list. If you're an old-school Al fan and you're wondering whether to buy this CD, BUY IT. It will live up to all of your Al expectations. There's a "Look the Rainbow" feel to it, there's a "Breakin' Away" feel to it, there's a "Jarreau" feel to it. There's even a "Glow" feel to it (when you think about tunes like "Milwaukee" and "Have You Seen the Child?"). Grassroots Al.

Unlike other classical-crossover artists minus Emma Shapplin, I believe Sarah Brightman works for art, not for money, or fame, or show off. Like what she said in an interview, she sees music a a whole--music is to be enjoyed (and categorization should never get in the way). That's apparent from this very endearing album La Luna.

This is my favorite jazz album of all time.  Put simply, this was Miles Davis at his best.  The notes on this album simply float, and yet it flows together better than anything I've ever heard.  The composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense.  Don't let the thirty second clips fool you.  I almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading.  I took a chance on it, and it was the best gamble I've ever made.  A must have for any jazz enthusiast

Grew up on this group. Love them then and love them now. Own the &quot;Best of&quot; Collection but you can never compile the best on one CD. For those Winans fans you know what I'm talking about. These brothers are music genuises especially Marvin Winans. Like Stevie Wonder they were ahead of their time. My favorite song on this album shares the message of all times. &quot;Together We Stand&quot; opens up the eyes to all race,religion, and creed that its time to come together if we want to see a change in this world regardless of background. Entire album is great including the celebrity appearances such as Stevie Wonder, Teddy Riley, and Aaron Hall.  I like the flavor the cameos add to this album. If you're into mid-tempo music this is the album to purchase

For those who have only heard the hits this is a fine addition for your collection.  Bruce and the boys were young and completely up to the task of handing out the long jams you find here.

Although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys, the PBBB is where the hippy generation,(this is a couple years pre-San Francisco, and before the Stones and Beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record),learned to JUST PLAY. Their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time, and is the single greatest influence on what became the San Francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's, (REALLY long and experimental jamming), so this is in fact the &quot;roots of the roots of the roots&quot; of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands, mixed-race bands, and, for all practical purposes, the white-blues-man in todays' world

If your a Goo Goo Doll fan, and you still do not have this CD, i deeply encourge you to go buy it now! This is The is The Goos like you've never heard them before. The CD is pure genius, and in my opinion the best cd i've ever heard

I've been a Jim Brickman fan for a few years now.  When I saw this CD came out, I could not resist getting it.  It is absolutely amazing and fully worth it.  When I first put it in my stereo, I had to sit there just to listen to the first few tracks without doing anything.  That was how impressive they were.  The title of the album is incredibly fitting.  While my roommate is venting about the latest drama in her group of friends, I have this CD turned up in my own little corner to "Escape" from it all.  I swear I could not have found anything more fitting to be listening to while trying to get away from real life for a bit.  If you love Jim Brickman, or just like soft jazz, or piano music, this CD is a must have

Brickman Back to his Roots
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
"I have been a Brickman fan since the very first album. Much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much "electronic enhancement." Escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums. There are three excellent vocals on the CD that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano.

This is a good compilation of AFI's songs over the 10+ years they've been together. It's easily worthy of 10 stars. This CD allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to Sing The Sorrow, and to get more intimate with the band. I havn't purchased this album YET, because I already have all their albums, but plan on it.

This guy is a freak of nature! Different but in the same vein as Illinoise. I loved it..No fillers to speak of. If you liked some of the more laid back songs on Illinoise!, you'll LOVE this album. Its great regardless.

Great punk rock album!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Having read some of the reviews here I just thought I should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band! While the singer (Conor Oberst) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands, he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout (unlike a band like Taking Back Sunday)

True 80's Pop Pleasure...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Anyone who had access to a radio in the 80's would know at least two songs by Missing Persons.  Their fun music and amazing flare (Dale did have pink and white stiped hair and it looked great!) make this a good party album.  I also have their album Color In Your Life and most of the songs are great.  Just as an added note, Warren Cuccarullo is now a member of Duran Duran (my personal favorite band) and has been since he appeared on their Notorious album which was released in 1986!!

I was looking for a cd that I could listen to all of the time.  Oh my God, I am breathless.  I was brought to tears as they sang "Mama".  My mother passed away in 2002 and I never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all.  All of Il Divo's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could.  Thank you for touching my heart.  I really recommend that you give this cd a chance.  All of these other people on the board that gave it a low score, obviously need a hearing aid and a heart.

When I first purchase this album the first time.  It was Exceptional then and it still is .  Exceptional and Gifted Group these Ladies rule the early 90's.  Some of my favorites Free Your Mind, My Lovin, It Ain't Over till the Fat Lady Sings, just to name a few.  Envogues voices all of them work masterfully together they way a head of their time.  As far as female groups they rank 5 stars in my book following such groups as Supremes, Labelle, TLC the had allot orginiality and appeal that drew people to them because of the voices and their orignal material.  They are trendsetters.

Great CD ...Check out the remix of Summer Breeze
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is a Great Classic Rock CD including some timeless songs.  If you like "Summer Breeze" as much as I do and have not heard the remix of it yet, you are in for a pleasent suprise.  A remix album came out in November of 2004 called "What Is Hip" and in my opinion is the best remix album of 70's music that I've ever heard.  Their version of "Summer Breeze" is near perfect.  A modernized, but not over the top version that manages to preserve the true melody of the song with out removing the original rhythm.  The entire album is great too. I have this "Greatest Hits" and the "What Is Hip" CD and simply can't get enough.  Here's a link to the CD.  ENJOY.

A review from a real rocker.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Ah, yes, it's Nirvana's "Nevermind" cd, released in 1991. I listen to all 80's pop-metal, or hair metal (Whitesnake, Winger, Van Halen, Y&T, Dokken) I could go on forever on 80's bands. (Of course there is Rick Springfield, and John Cougar Mellencamp). I am a true rocker here, I know all the true bands out there, I know everything about them. I have reasons for this.

This is a fantastic album. The fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release (and they're not the beatles or u2 or anything) should speak volumes. I have played this CD countless times over the years and I am amazed that I am not sick of it. I am a pretty constant consumer of new music. Get this CD - you won't regret it! (PS I've never done an Amazon review before, but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me). It is melodic, catchy, uplifting and cheeky - in short, a little piece of musical bliss.

Greatest Ever?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This was the break through record for Pink Floyd that would place them in the super-league. The strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and Dave Gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. Production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential. Overall the record works well as a whole yet I do feel 'Money' seems out of place. The problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption.

Punk-O-Rama.....Enough Said
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This was the first Punk-O-Rama CD I listened to, and boy I was not dissapointed. Most of the songs on this CD are the type of punk I would listen to, Quite fast and energetic. The best song on the CD has to be either NOFX - Bath of Least Resistance (NOFX being the greatest punk band of all time, of course), or Beatsteaks - Let me in. I heard the Beatsteaks for the first time on this CD and there absolutely bloody excellent. Obviously, The Cd is made complete with songs from the Descendents, Pulley, Pennywise, Dropkick Murphy's. The only let down on this CD is Noise Conspiracy, there song on this CD, well plainly sucks i'm sorry to say. But overall this CD is one hell of a good listen if your into punk. That's all, oh yeah, buy it! by

Neil Young strikes again
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Neil Young's latest release has some very clever and interesting songs.  They are very political so unless you are a completest who likes Neil Young, if you agree with President Bush, this album will be a turn-off.  For the politically neutral or those who agree with Neil Young this is a good album.  Maybe this is not Neil Young's best but it still is a good album

Gun's & Roses came out in the nick of time. Record companies were mass producing cookie cutter bands and they all sound the same. G&R made their debut on the music scene in 87 but didn't get big until almost late 88 early 89. Appitite is a true masterpiece. Welcome to the Jungle, It's So Easy, Mr. Brownstone, My Michelle....The list goes on and on. Put it in turn it up to 10 and Rock On! The they made a mistake. they realeased an albums worth of great songs on 2 albums. So instead of another masterpiece they wound up with 2 ok albums. Then they vanished. Anyone who is a fan of the music but couldn't care less about Axl should pick up Velvet Revolver with Slash and Scott Wieland from Stone Temple Pilots

Digressing from their first 2 albums, Transmutation(5 stars)and Sacrifist( 5 stars),  Praxis unleashes Metatron.  Trimmed down to a 3 piece with Laswell, Bucket and Brain covering all bases,  Metatron lacks Bootsy's space bass,  Yamatsuka Eye's agonizing screams or John Zorn's out of tune saxamaphoning, but it still rocks. track 1 is a laid back acoustic # and is absolutly beautiful. The album lacks the speed of some of Sacrifist's songs but makes up in phat grooves.  Half of the Collection cd(again 5 stars) is from this album, but with nothing from Transmutation, hmmm.  Instead of going further Ill' say this.... Get THIs Album at alll costs.  Burn copies for friends and spread the gospel according to Praxis

<Text>
I have to admit that, at first listening, I found some aspects of Ms.Belle's interpretations of these pieces disorienting. However, as I listened to these covers repeatedly, I can now say that I understand better what the vocalist is after. Not that I always agree with her and with George Duke,the arranger/producer, but I agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened.

Amazing Solo Album from an Amazing Writer
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Okay, take everything that you know about John Squire. Strip away the amazing Stone Roses first album, the not so amazing follow up, the nice brit pop of his work with the Seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and I honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change drastically. They would realize that every track on it is a winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful, the vocals might be grating at first (Think Robert Forster (The Go-betweens) circa Before Hollywood) but that upon repeated listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving. What you expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like or dislike it and this album is no exception. People should listen to it for what it is and not for what John Squire was...John Squire is an established song writer who has moved beyond what he used to do (who hasn't moved on in 13 years? minus Robert Smith of course!) and now writes beautiful pop songs...John Squire has grown up just like his original audience has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that

Breaking the sound barrier
</Text>

Wow!  There's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing.  The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy--making you want to (& will if no one's around) sing along.  The lyrics are fine, meaningful, & personally touching--about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people with hopes, feelings, needs, desires, & all the rest of what makes people human.  The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style).  She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling.  I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl & Something More (on the TV show Vegas of all place).  Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show--winning awards as they so deserve.  The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring.  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles.  Yes, the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive.  And, the trio wrote all the songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them).  How many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man?  I wonder if they are unique?  Well, they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?.  Of course, country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority of listeners ARE.  This has become one of my favorite albums, at the speed of sound.  IMHO, it's terrific

I'll have to accept that even tough I'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release, the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there.  For me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album, it's very melodic and more mature.  Also the acoustic version of "the diary of jane" is amazing.  I personally recommend the songs "breath", "evil angel" and my favorite "dance with the devil"

A friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago, I listened to a few minutes of it and was like "What is this crap?" and I shelved it for a couple months. I then picked it back up and gave it another listen. To my surprise it was really catchy to me. The music (and lyrics) are simple, but thats what I like about them. Theyre simple! This is a great college-rock cd. I plan on checking out more Teenage Fanclub, and I suggest you do the same. Notable tracks are Sidewinder, What You Do To Me, and Is This Music?

It's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now. I think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday. But it didn't. It came out in the summer of 1979. It was the summer before my sophomore year in college, my first summer away from home. For at least a week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select side 1 of "Rust Never Sleeps." It took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over. And then, when I did, for the next week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select Side 2 of "Rust Never Sleeps." My flatmates never complained.

THE REAL DEAL
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This CD is great.  It is a must have.  Picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly.  You hear the rain, the thunder in the distance, you sense the storm getting closer.  The storm is over head, loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for cover.  The thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a constant presents.  The thunder rolls on but the wild life moves in, bullfrogs, owls in the distance, all the animals are alive now.  This cd is all in one, the real deal.  It is not all thunder.  I love it.  I also bought Thunderstorm [Rykodisc]; this was a waste of money.  To me, in my opinion it sounds like the storm just knocked the cable out, static and more static.

I purchased this CD during the lowest time of my life emotionally. Every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief, especially the title track, Deep Peace. I would listen to it over and over, bathing in the lush healing sounds. Each element, from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs, is seemingly structured at a spiritual level. This is more than ambient music, it's true music therapy.

The Edward Scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores.  I truly believe this is Danny Elfman's best score and believe me, he's done some great scores!  The music is so moving.  The childrens chorus mixed with the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this sweet, beautiful film.  Even people who haven't seen this film have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many film previews and commercials.  A must-have for any Danny Elfman and/or Tim Burton fan

Jodeci's Forever My Lady has a problem that most nineties R&B releases had at that time, if the fast songs were tight then the slow songs suck and vice versa. Jodeci's first CD had some of the finest slow songs to come off of one CD in 1991. Stay, Forever My Lady, Come & Talk To Me, U&I,and I'm Still Waiting rank with the best but every single fast is hot trash

Good Introduction to an Interesting Genere
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Goth meets Cabaret, or rather Gothic music influenced by Cabaret. Thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by Projekt. The eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the "dark cabaret" scene, and do so quite well. The first song, Coin-Operated Boy by the Dresden Dolls, is a great start, and the CD continues onward to devious Evil Night Together by Jill Tracy (which sets up a wonderful film noir mood) and on to the darker, electronic dance number Cabaret Fortune Teller by Audra, to a remix of Knock Three Times on My Coffin by Projekt veterans Black Tape for a Blue Girl. Along the way numerous other bands are covered.

This is an amazing, beautiful album.  Probably a little more difficult to get into than Streethawk, but after about the 4th or 5th listen, I found it more rewarding.  The music is very dense, and the lyrics are beautifully poetic (it helps that Dan Bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time).  A great album for any fan of intelligent independent music

A Hidden Gem

This is The Jacksons second album for epic and producers Gamble and Huff. It would be their last with Gamble and Huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should. Music's Takin Over, Different Kind of Lady and Do What You Wanna are great, catchy dance tracks. The real greatness here lies in the ballads where Michael's voice is in peak form. Even Though You're Gone and Find Me A Girl are classic ballads. So good, I feel that Find Me A Girl is probably the best Michael Jackson song you've never heard. This is probably Michael Jackson's most overlooked album and its one of his best! The Jacksons all sing together great and you can see why Destiny and Triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded. Overall, great ballads, catchy feel good dance tracks, and Michael Jackson singing his heart out. Get this, you will not be dissaponted

Hayley Westenra, at only 18 years old, is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come. This is an uplifting and at times, spiritual album that shows shades of greatness. Throughout, Westenra's voice is captivating, though the musical scores are at times, sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent.

In Boyz II Men's sophomore album, II, they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer Dallas Austin and founder Michael Bivins.  This LP begins with the deepest of gratitude on "Thank You" produced by the group and Dallas Austin.  Both "All Around The World" and "U Know" are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them, but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights.  One thing they do is provide another angle for Boyz II Men.  For a more relaxing environment, "Vibin'" has a rather simple instrumentation, lyrics and vocals.  "I Sit Away" is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by Tony Rich and production by veteran L.A. Reid and Tony Rich.  Stepping into a more modern jazz feel "Jezzebel" strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal.  Over a piano solo, Boyz II Men harmonize on "Khilil (Interlude)" to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with "Trying Times" written and produced by Wanya Morris, Tim Kelley & Bob Robinson.  Hit maker Babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights "I'll Make Love To You" and "Water Runs Dry".  Heavyweights Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on "On Bended Knee".  "50 Candles" drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content "...feels like one of those nights..."  They show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on "Yesterday" they perform accapella.  If real talent that you seek, members Shawn, Michael, Nathan and Wanya has uncompromising talent for any age, era, or time that you can enjoy for long time.

If you think yer gonna puke everytime you have to suffer through a "country" song from Nashville these days, and you happen to like classic rock, you would probably appreciate what Shooter's trying to do here. Folks, this is the Real Deal. I don't mean real country or real rock - this is a hybrid - I mean he's making music that is honest and down to earth. A flash in the pan, he's not. He's going to be around for awhile

Boxcar Racer v2.0 - Good for some, bad for others
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Tom DeLonge is at it again with a new band and a new album.  Even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from Boxcar Racer, Angels and Airwaves managed to have a completely different sound.  They dropped the more punk rock tone of Boxcar Racer in favor of an emo-alternative style of rock.  The first released single "The Adventure" is quite enjoyable and even though I haven't checked too deeply into it, I think it's the theme song for NBC's Studio 60.

After watching the movie walk the line, I wanted to hear more of Johnny Cash. All these years(35 of them) I always thought he was just a slow folk singer. His music is non-stop foot tapping soul grabbing stuff. He toured with Elvis Presely and Jerry Lee Lewis. He inspired musicians like Bob Dylan. I am so glad I bought this CD. It's the best purchase I made all year.

First up I give this album a 4.5/5 for the fac that it has REAL hiphop beats and good lyrics. Real hiphop, they stayed true to the sound. I just didnt give it a 5 since im not the biggest TCQ fan and of that style. But all these emcees spit hott lyrics in this album. Tracks like "Keep It Movin", "Hot Sex" have ill beats. This album does have a real jazzy sound to it, which im not the biggest fan of, but its more of a unique style, and they deserve props for trying new styles. So overall this is a really good album, and worth getting.

One of the greatest debuts of all-time
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Try to name some of the greatest debut rock albums.  Let me give you one ground rule though:  It has to be from a band that put out at least five albums (so no Stone Roses, Sugar, Verve or Jane's Addiction, e.g.).  Here are some of mine, off the top of my head: Led Zeppelin I, In the Court of the Crimson King, Days of Future Passed, The Doors, Boy (U2), C.S.N., Can't Buy a Thrill (Steely Dan), Ten (Pearl Jam), Murmur (REM).  I'm sure there are a number of others that I'm forgetting.  Oh yeah, one more: the incredible "Ferment," by Catherine Wheel.

Do It All Again Bleu
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought a copy for a friend recently and she said "His music sounds so fresh and it's so singable.  The lyrics are meaty, too, not just fluffy pop. I'm kind of obsessing over this music right now--which is fun!  Thanks so much... I'd like to see him in concert sometime." I had this album for a year before I really got into it, since it takes a couple of listens to really appreciate.  At first listen I really liked We'll Do It All Again, and put it onto my MP3.  A year later I finally got the album out again and it bleu me away.  I realize that there is something slightly Barry Mannilowish about We'll Do It All Again, because he has some lungs, not because of style or anything.  He reminds me more of Jellyfish, or They Might Be Giants.  Some songs are so pathetic, vulnerable, and a little too honest for comfort as far as lyrics go, but they are energetic and hopeful in their delivery.  Anyone who appreciates art for arts sake will probably like this album.  The songwriting is superb and precisely produced. The second hidden track is a real gem, that you don't need to relate to in order to appreciate.  The lyrics are clever and fun even though several songs have a theme of loneliness.

Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth came out of no where with this classic in "92". I was expecting the T-ROY tribute to be the only highlight, but this joint was bangin! The very underrated CL had the dope metaphors and complex lyrics. Chocolate Boy Wonder had the legendary "horns" going on. The whole album is a banger. Fav's are Pete's Sake, The Basement(Pete's cuz Heavy D rips  it), Mecca and the Soul Brother, Troy- They Reminisce, Straighten it Out( a kick in the balls for bootleggers), Ghetto's of the Mind and Skinz(CL's cuz Grand Puba steals the show on this one). Eternally Classic, rock on.

If you like this, you'll like Eric Johnson's Venus Isle album too.  Two of my all time favorites

This might be the best CD that has come out this year.  It may be Will Oldham's best CD since "Viva Last Blues." It may be better than "Viva Last Blues" although these are two different styled CDs.  "The letting go" has a mostly very mellow sound.  Almost every song is beautiful.  The string and guitar melodies are uplifting.  Will Oldham's voice is grounding, it is the familiar voice you have heard for the past decade or so.  Dawn McCarthy's voice will then again lift you up.  McCarthy's voice is a fantastic companion to Oldham's.  Other singers/bands have tried to use a female voice to echo or accompany the lead vocal and it has often become irritating.  This is not the case with "the letting go," McCarthy's accompaniment adds so much to the album but without taking away from Oldham.  I haven't listened to a Will Oldham album since "Ease down the Road." This makes me want to go back and listen to those albums I have missed.  One song in particular, "The Seedling" (I believe) has a different sound than the rest of the album.  It has a harsher sound, but is still a good song.

This is a wonderful effort by the Del Castillo brothers and their band. Mark and Rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that I have ever heard. I hate that anyone would compare them to the Gypsy Kings or Strunz and Farrah, because I believe they (Del Castillo) are far superior. Even though I am a huge fan of Santana, I think Brothers of the Castle and Vida are more entertaining and satisfying than Santana's last CD. If you are a fan of this genre, you should possess both Del Castillo CD's.....Brothers of the Castle and Vida. Their live show is among the best that I have ever seen

As he did with "Parade", the soundtrack to his last vanity project "Under the Cherry Moon", Prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to "Graffiti Bridge", which is a hopelessly silly film. No matter. "Graffiti Bridge", Prince's first album of the 90's, is also one of Prince's best albums of the 90's.

'Incandescent' enlightens...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have loved the Swans since my Danceteria days in early 80s New York. But its a fitful, frustrating love. You get the sense from 'Incandesent' that the Swans forgot to stop partying.  That they never took the time to put together more than a handful of songs.  Oh, but what songs they were.  This collection is for completists and aging post-punker (like myself) who wished they'd shared a pint with the boys back when simply getting stoned was a subversive act. Its a nice collection of beautiful, quirky oddities here. But a few gems are missing "Holy Holy", "1982", "World of Milk and Blood" come to mind. Maybe on an 'Ashes' reissue.  In the meantime, scoop this up.  Simpson & Company deserve the attention. If you really care about the band, buy it directly from their label, Renascent. That way the company (and the band) can make a few pennies. Maybe enough to mine the crates for a second hits collection.

I love this album, the best of Phil Collins.  I believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut.  I know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times/suffering with his ex wife.  He did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well.  He is a great composer.  Too bad most of his new songs...2006, times are different and so is his life, I do not enjoy them as much.  Once an artist becomes more Self-Actualized much of their best work becomes just that a memory.

And you will to. This music conveys the happy feeling of Latin music produced for the American ear from 1946 to 1949. I picked up the album from Amazon after listening to selected cuts offered by the Yahoo Music radio service -- "El Cumbanchero" and "Cuban Pete". The cuts are almost all strong and all are well recorded, especially when you compare the sound quality to those on some other big band recordings that have been reissued.

Chamber music at its finest
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I purchased this CD with the intent of finding fine players playing fine music. What I found, however, was and outstanding example of chamber music as its finest. The ensemble these 3 players generate is some of the finest ensemble music playing recorded. Each player displays exceptional technique, both in the mechanical and lyrical aspects of their playing. Most impressive is listening to Istomen who, playing a very technically and lyrically demanding part, voices his playing with such finess and carefull attention to detail to the strings; a feat very difficult to do as a pianist. This is an excellent recording for the professional to study a score from or for the avid listener to play over and over

I appreciate bands like Ima Robot, Film School and electroclash artists for trying to add a little balance into Alternative music, or at least I appreciate Film School for trying to merge the beauty of Electronica with Alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the New Wave you loved in the 80's. The thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band. Have you heard Depeche Mode's albums with a wind of Boards of Canada?

Without a doubt, this is a must-have for any fan of the Go-Betweens and the place to start if you are new to the band.  "A man far wiser than myself once referred to "16 Lovers Lane" as 'the indie Rumours'" the liner notes say in this fantastic re-issue of the Go-Betweens ultimate set of songs.  No truer words were ever spoken about this amazing set.  Why this album didn't spawn at least five top 10 singles is a mystery that will never be solved.  But needless to say this is a fantastic set made even better by the wonderful packaging and extras included with this re-release

Gene Watson was one of the finest voices in country music, and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice.  Considered by some to be "hard country", I find Gene Watson to have a more "pop" oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs;  and in the '70's, that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts.  While many of the songs on this album are pure country, others are the typical, drab, 70's pop that filled the void between the Nashville Sound and the New Traditional era of the 80's.  In any case, there is no doubt that Gene Watson earned his spot in Country Music, and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today;  including his signature songs "Farewell Party" and "Love in the Hot Afternoon".  If you prefer the more traditional country sound, his "You Could Know as Much About a Stranger" and "Should I Come Home" are also included

Gene Watson's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for Sonny James, Ernest Tubb, and Dottie West.  I had never heard of him but then when I heard his voice on the CD I knew the songs.  It's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should.  Every song is great but the one which I really like is &quot;The Old Man and His Horn&quot;.  This was a song I had never heard.  It also shows the versatility of Gene's song selections.  He has the best voice of any country singer I have ever heard

Honestly, Led Zeppelin is the ONLY artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not ONE bad song.  When you listen to one of their albums in your car, there's no, "Oh, I really like track 2, but I don't like the next couple, so I'll skip to track 5 after that one's over."  Now it is common opinion that the classic albums of Led Zeppelin are the first five, and "Houses of the Holy" is the fifth one.  This is Zeppelin at their pinnacle, which in my opinion, they never fall from.

Kate Bush At Her Best
</Text>

"The Dreaming was one of those albums that I found in my parents CD collection when I was young and I haven't outgrown it yet. My parents seemed to hate it and never bought a Kate Bush CD after it (though I recently bought her whole collection except "The Whole Story" as it's just a greatest hits!). This album took me a very long time to get into however. I listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because I thought it was too strange. I took it out then several years later and loved it. I would now say it could be my all time favourite CD and is better than "Hounds Of Love" as I see it. The songs all stand on their own and Bush's voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through. This is the only album that I will never skip a track because I'm always in the mood for them all.

What else can be said about this great CD?  It's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs. "Child of Vision" is the best (the piano solo is killer) of the best, but this is one of those rare CD's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end (no skipping over songs you don't like). A true classic

A lot of music fans have mused over why Matthew Sweet did not achieve greater success with the masses despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs. "Sick of Myself" single-handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its possibilities. But in retrospect Sweet simply wasn't a very marketable commodity for the music industry, and on top of that his vocals and lyrics somehow didn't grab people. Its not that he doesn't sing with passion or feeling, but somehow the words seem to get lost in the mix. Perhaps its a production thing; regardless, the vocals on a MS album always seem to be secondary to the music and that is a no-no for any great singer-songwriter. There are some truly impressive (albeit derivative) stuff here: "What Matters" is in my opinion the greatest Byrds song never written, "Hide" is a beautiful piano ballad that wouldn't seem out of place on Badfinger compilation, "If Time Permits" has some of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by Brian Wilson, etc. etc. "I've Been Waiting" works well in combining catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire, and "Girlfriend" is for the most part a great rocker. However, after the relatively simple production of Girlfriend, his later albums got bogged down in an attempt to recreate a "wall of sound" feeling, which quite frankly doesn't really work unless you're Phil Spector. Not much here can be completely discounted and the new songs fit in quite well (although I probably would have included "Evangeline" at the expense of "Ready"). Despite the undeniable quality of the music there is nothing life-changing here and ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being life-changing. Still heartily recommended for fans of catchy, melodic pop-rock

After Trouble and his Austin City Limits appearance, I thought he was just another very good singer songwriter.  This follow up has made me reconsider, because this is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist.  He waited and it was worth the wait.

I've been a Robben Ford fan since 1979. Each time he offers a new recording, I try to purchase it as quickly as possible. Robben can ROCK and play slow blues. Every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again. I can't say enough! Robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation! If you like Robben Ford, don't miss Chris Cain. This man is also a guitar genius

beauty isnt the word for this album
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
To be honest I can't think of a word that can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it being the most beautiful sound I've heard. For me listening to this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely complete at the same time, never before has an album stopped me in my tracks as firmly as this one. My favourite songs on the album are "the only moment we were alone" and "six days at the bottom of the ocean" every time my ears are blessed with these artworks I'm am fixated on nothing else but them. I literally cannot communicate with anyone or anything I just have to listen to them intently. This album is not as experimental as "those who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live forever" but I feel it is just as good and the songs are put together impeccably well, with no song being neither longer nor shorter than it has to be. I love the pure, clean sound of this album and see it as light as the wind. The trance that this album provides is indescribable; I'm not saying if you buy this album it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely from a personal note. Either way I strongly recommend this band and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase, for you can have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced, written, recorded, thought out and sounding. Buy it, you will not regret your choice one bit.

Great CD - one song a remake, but most sound original
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The one song I know is a remake is "Goodnight My Love."  I know this because I have it on the original 45 issue and the CD version is an inferior remake.  But the others with which I'm familiar - but don't have original vinyl to compare, only memories - seem authentic.

I bought this CD after I'd watched the movie the first three times. The music is wonderful.  I bought it specifically for the song they sing in the church scene - "I Don't Care to Stay Here Long" and I want it played at my own funeral way out there in "someday".  You can't hear it without smiling and the words are much easier to understand on the CD than in the movie.  But just in case, here's the first foot-stompin' verse:

We started playing this for our one year old when we were driving on a short trip out of town. As babies sometimes do, she began screaming and was unconsolable... UNTIL we turned on Rocket Ship Beach. Polly wolly doodle calmed her right down and continues to do so. We played that song at least 6 times in a row that day! now that she's a little older, she points to the cd player in the car if something else is playing, requesting her cd be played.

His singing style is very unique as are his lyrics.  He has an eclectic mix of love songs, "we are the world" type songs and a few others on this album.  He has the staying power for long the long term and I would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes.  I loved Streetcorner Symphony!  It is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me.  Lonely No More is my theme song for right now in my life - needless to say I am replaying grooves in that one!  Enjoy this album - I sure do

Like many Amazon reviewers, I play a teensy bit of guitar.  I know just enough to know how incredible these guys are.  This is the best, most exciting acoustic playing I've heard since Al DiMeola cut "Race With Devil on Spanish Highway" on his Elegant Gypsy Suite LP.  Watching the Del Castillo brothers shred on the DVD part of this set will assure that I don't get anywhere near my guitar for a long time.  Since Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Spy Kids, etc) filmed the performances, we get appallingly good, tight shots of the fretwork.  People, it can't be done.  I will henceforth concentrate on harmonica, and try to forget that Sugar Blue does about the same level of impossibility on that instrument.

I, like many others, have been waiting for this album for quite some time.  Right from the first track, I was hooked.  "All My Days" is a haunting, melodic, heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album.  "Breathe" has a subdued yet powerful message.  "Home" is just plain fun.  "Song For You" is sweet, somber, and hopeful.

This album came out about 8 years before I was born. All the years, I still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play WBSS or Billie Jean. Now I know all the lyrics and music videos from this album. This is MJ in his prime. Unfortunately, we will never get another epic like this again. Michael is sadly a target in the media, but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not. Every song off here is a classic. One song I thought was unneccesary was "Baby Be Mine". But otherwise, it's excellent. If you starting an MJ collection, get this album first. Trust me.

Hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like Lady Sovereign. She is not only lyrically impressive, but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving, which is basically what she sets out to do. I dont know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the UK, but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now. And i will patiently await for S.O.V. debut US album.

Yes, there may be some small issues with the sound quality, but you get used to it, and Wilhelm Kempff is definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th Century, so it is worth it. These are incredible performances that are often justly called definitive. Kempff seems to always bring out every theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity, whereas other pianists would not have nearly as much attention to detail and neglect many subtle themes. Highly recommended

The Darkest Child in her eyes

Kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth. The Dreaming was underrated when it was first released, but I think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time. This is a superb album, tracks like Sat in Your Lap, Suspended in Gaffa, Leave It Open, Night of The Swallow, Houdini, and Get Out of My House proving this point. There's lots of anger on this album, as Kate put it herself many years ago, and it is her "darkest" effort to date, but it's pure brilliance! Buy it and be convinced.....

I am a big Ambrosia fan and I love "Biggest Part of Me", "You're the Only Woman", "How Much I Feel" and the newer track "I Just Can't Let Go".  However, I wish this CD contained all of their Billboard Hot 100 hits.  The CD is missing their cover of "Magical Mystery Tour" (#39) and "How Can You Love Me" (#86).  For the casual listener, this CD is perfect.  For the chart hit completionists out there, it misses a couple songs.  I bought this CD used for $1.99, which was a HUGE bargain for the songs included.  For that price, I can certainly try to download the missing tracks

She really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well. I totally recommend this CD to start if you have not heard much of her music...SHe truly is addicting once you hear these songs...These songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey

If you are expecting "Safari Moon Pt. 2", you will be dissapointed. Air took a more adventuourous, darker, ambient, serious, experimental, and ultimtately brilliant journey into electronic music. The songs here range from sounding like Aphex Twin (without the weird off-putting effects or heavy drums) to Thievery Corp. Air still has a beautiful sense of melody and as usual the tunes themselves are beautifully and creatively put together (even a throwaway Air song is a well-crafted one). Overall, all us true hardcore Air fans love this album. Those who only loved MS may not like it, but that's their loss I say

It's impossible to like all of country music, but Randy Travis is liked by even those who don't like country music. From 1986 and through the 90's he was always on top or near the top of the country charts.  His calm, nasal drawl reminds me a bit of Lefty Frizell, but there's no mistaking his unique style. These are some of the best recordings in the history of country music including Digging Up Bones, Forever and Ever, Amen, Too Gone Too Long, Is It Still Over?, Hard Rock Bottom Of Your Heart etc. Randy had 16 No. 1's on the country charts. There are 20 cuts here.  If you only want one CD with all his greatest hits this is your logical choice. By the way, the sound from Rhino is bright and punchy and the booklet features dates, neat pixs, and peak positions. You've got a winner for life with this one!

I personally like this compilation of Prince, it's got most of the songs I like and the sound is great. Sure, there could have been a few more songs included, like "Pop Life", "Hot Thing", but when compared to the other compilations, this disc has more of the songs that are a must-have, for me, such as "I Wanna Be Your Lover", which I don't think was included on any of the other compilations. So, it's just a matter of weighing what songs you most want, so that's why I chose this disc and I'm glad I did!

For the longest time, I have thought that observational truths were highly prone to being the most piercing of things: I have believed that the truth could either hurt (or disturb) you terribly, or make you laugh so hard, to the point of hysteria--or a combination of both extremes. There are many things to put this theory to the test, but to cut it all short, all one would need to do (if by chance it hasn't been done already) is experience the observational humor of Richard Pryor to possibly get a better understanding of what I am talking about. This classic comedy album from 1975 is a prime example.

I think this my first EP purchase ever - and I generally feel that, despite the quality many offer, EPs just are not worth it. Sam Beam was clearly on a mission to change my mind, as these apparent "outtakes" from The Creek Drank The Cradle are every bit as good as that miracle debut - if not better. I only very recently discovered Iron and Wine through Our Endless Numbered Days, and have since been backtracking only to see that this remarkably talented artist can do no wrong. The standout track to me is The Night Descending, it has the feel of a track pulled right out of the past. The other four tracks are just as excellent though, and I think Sam's managed to make an avid fan out of me. Damn... and just when I thought there were no new artists to be excited about!

"Horizon" was a turning point in the recording career of the Carpenters--a more sophisticated sound more suited to Karen's rich and warm voice. But the album was rather short, and some of the songs just weren't up to the standards expected by their fans, which was reflected in the sales of the album, which was their slowest selling album up to that point.

First, I'd like to say that I am so glad there are artists like Amel around who aren't trying to fit in with today's commercial R&B scene. As a long time fan of R&B and soul music I can't help but feel sad and dissapointed at the direction the genre is taking, especially in regards to female singers. She may be beautiful, but she doesn't need to use her looks to overcompensate for any lack of vocal talent by flaunting herself. Amel has a beautiful soul, and you can hear that through her wonderful voice and lyrics. Every song on this album has at some point or another touched me, some songs straight away while others grew on me slowly. You know how sometimes when you're listening to music and a particular lyric or vocal piece makes you shiver? Amel's got that down for me.

AFIs change

<text>
<Text>
This is where AFI began their sound change from their first 2 cd's (answer that & stay fashionable, Very Proud of Ya). It is much more serious than the first 2, alot angrier, heavier, Darker, and more screaming/yelling as well. Some people say this is their best, I disagree, I prefer their "punkier" 1st 2 BUT i still enjoy this alot, it's all down to personal taste, it gets a 5/5 for me

Probably Robben's best album
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have just about all of Robben's albums and I believe that this is his best work. The interpretations and musicianship are outstanding. Robben's improvisational playing actually comes across more like  composition. His  technique is extremely melodic. He is, in my opinion, one the best blues  guitar players around and his profound knowledge of jazz gives his music a  very refreshing &quot;twist&quot;. Check out his prowess on &quot;You cut  me to the bone&quot;, &quot;Prison of love&quot; or &quot;My love will  never die&quot;

Although I like this album, there's nothing that especially stands out about it. It's typical Bright Eyes, and if you already love the band you won't be disappointed. However, it's not one of their best albums. It's not as good as Lifted, not as addicting as Fevers and Mirrors, and not as raw and endearing as Letting off the Happiness. But yet again, Conor succeeds in writing songs that capture all of the emotion without making me ill in a Dashboard Confessional sort of way

I first encountered Bird3 opening for Veruca Salt the summer of 2001.  That band had put their faith into Bird and so have I.  We fell in love with them all together.  This band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul-baring lyrics to create something unique, beautiful, and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today.  You'll find yourself not only humming along, but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments.  You will not once regret buying this piece of art

A lot of great music on one CD
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Earlier, I had an LP called "Best of the Band" that was 10 cuts and maybe 35 minutes. This is 18 well chosen cuts and double the length. There are a lot of "best of/greatest hits" type collections from veteran artists that originally came out in 70's or early 80's that had a limited number of songs and length. This IS a case where the record decided to offer more songs and give the customer a better value for their money. The music itself is 5 stars and they were a major artist due to the fact that they had 3 very good but very different lead vocalists handling the vocals. It gives the music a lot more variety and they put out a lot of fine music in their 1968-76 prime. As an aside, 3 of the Band members (Helm, Danko, and Hudson) also put out some good music in the 1990's

This album is great but I'm looking for a song that I think they sung. It goes: Pressing on we're pressing on (repeat). Waiting on Jesus to answer our call we're holding on (repeat) Pressing, pressing, pressing. If anyone knows the name of the song, or has any suggestions on who sings this song, please email me at udeebear1984@yahoo.com. Thank you and have a blessed day! :

Hot Hot Heat is one of the few new bands to pique my interest. Their first release was decent, but "Elevator" is even better. Great tunes, drums and guitars - and, of course, Steve Bays' yelping vocals. There's only three songs I really don't care for - "Pickin' It Up", "Soldier In A Box" and "Shame On You". Looking forward to the next CD

Tracks like &quot;golden touch&quot; &quot;V.I.C.E&quot; well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging&quot;stumbble and fall&quot; which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. If you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have

Bring Me The Head (of the Record Label Executives)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The earlier reviews pretty much said it all; this is pretty much one of THE best and most overlooked bands from the 90s.  Swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often, however, if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band, because they aren't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock.  Yes, rock.  Who knew it could still be done, and believe me, they do it well, and uniquely.  If you've listened to Swervedriver before, then tehre isn't too much more to say - buy this album.  It's not as hi-fi as 99th Dream or Mezcal Head (in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade), but not as fast or dirty as Raise.  Now, if you have never listened to Swervedriver, this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes.  Personally, I would suggest starting with 99th Dream or Mezcal Head; either way, this has all the qualities of every Swervedriver album - great lyrics, superb and unique songs, and that urge for more when it's over.  Sadly, this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together (however, some vestiges exist in the form of Toshack Highway).  But if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so, if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - Swervedriver is a must

Every thing he sings is perfect, I've yet to find one song that doesn't move me.  This CD has some beauties.  &quot;Daughter of Mine&quot; is priceless.  &quot;Steal Away&quot; is very nice.  &quot;One Small  Star&quot; brings tears.  This arrangement of &quot;Voyage&quot; is  probably the best I've heard.  His traditional songs (&quot;When you and I  were young Maggie&quot; and &quot;Mary of Argyle&quot;) are beautiful.  I  can't find anything on this CD I couldn't listen to for hours.  I truly  love music and listen to it constantly.  I find myself reaching for the  McDermott CD's almost exclusively.  I have them all, more please

This CD offers a great deal of incredible music by John Lennon during 1969 and the early 1970's when he fought our government in order for him and Yoko to live in the United States. The quality of the music is excellent and after you listen to this CD you want to run to watch the film!

THERE'S NOTHING LIKE ETTA JAMES
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
In the early 60's Etta James was to R&amp;B what Patsy Cline was to country. She could cross over and yet remain true to her roots, and that's only one part of a nearly 50 year career! From the velvety cross over soul of &quot;At Last&quot; to the hard driving Memphis soul of &quot;Tell Mama&quot;, this is one legend who certainly deserves a wider audience than she has today. She ranks right up with Aretha Franklin as an influential vocalist. I took far too many years to discover her power. If you haven't given her a serious look yet, stop wasting time and begin here

I INHALED this CD.  After all the hype and hyper blowin' up about this dance/punk/rock genius, I finally broke down and bought it.  Not that I was old enough to get into the discos in the mid 70's-early/mid 80's(I was still in elementary school, then middle school), but I remember(and still love) the groups that influenced this disc...The Buzzcocks, Heaven 17, PiL, Blondie...hell even the Rolling Stones "Some Girls" album.  And yes, I have to say(after finding "Death Disco-Songs Under the Dance Floor 1978-1984" CD and I'm ordering it)the old stuff is more fun.  But for the hipsters who don't know this is not original genre,it's pretty great.  No, it's very great.  The first song "Daft Punk is Playing at my House" was fun, and both discs made it worth driving through  snowy/sleety/frozen rain covered streets to work out at the gym these last couple weeks

With a compelling story, great music, great lyrics, and two outstanding female leads, Aida certainly delievers. Right from the start with the goregous "Every Story Is A Love Story", the listener is captured by the wonderful spirit of the show. The seamless tranisition between ballads and showtunes is flawless.

This was one of those rare performances where Dylan's raw energy swept the stage and transformed these selections from his collection into somthing entirely new and great. The sound is rough, the intonation is off, the recording is filled with horrible buzzes, whistles, and clicks. None of which matters. Once youe listened to some of the tracks on this disk, you'll prefer them to the original album cuts. I know I do. Absolutely essential to any collection of Dylan's work, "Hard Rain" is not to be missed.

'Shelter Me'; a little slower, but still The Waifs.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
For any seasoned fans of The Waifs (or anyone out there with a predilection for folksy girl duets sporting brilliant guitar skills and voices to boot), 'Shelter Me' will be no departure --and no disapointment -- from what you've heard before. The album weighs heavily on The Waifs accoustical appeal. The majority of the songs carry themselves without backbeat or excessive instrumentation -- mostly it's just the girls, their guitars, and the usual, typically wonderful songwriting that comes from Josh Cunningham, the third member of this stellar folk ensemble. The title track 'Shelter Me' is a gorgeous, magnificently charged piece that will leave you reeling, "Take me now where shelter be/ before there's nothing left of me." Vikki's final track 'Spotlight' is a pure gem, emotional and raw but utterly beautiful. 'Attention' finishes the album well with that familliar Waify energy and pulse, almost blue grass, almost country, but totally wonderful.

A FULL R&B CD! An album I never have to skip songs on!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I love EVERY track on Ne-Yo's CD "in my own words!" Next let me thank Ne-Yo for bringing true R&B back to the industry! I dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife R&B. R&B is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow LOVE songs. And from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. I ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until I got so tired of them, and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music I dont like) to play "so sick" by Ne-Yo. It was a great song. This is literally the FIRST and only R&B album that I never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song! Ne-Yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! He is a lyrical genius. His voice is soothing and melodic. Most R&B albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed R&B songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the CD, but THIS album has ALL songs that are great. All of the tracks on this album are great, but here are the ones that are SUPERB:

Not speaking or understanding Tibetian, didn't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful movie, and the music from this soundtrack is the reason why. It guides you like a sherpa, gently leading you along the high trails, powerfully pulling you to the heights of ever thinning air. You are at once engulfed in the Tibetian life, you live the experience through the deep gutteral chants, singing bowls, and drums

Oh! Boy! how things have change..years ago i invested thousands of dollars in a killer Dvd-audio/Super-audio multichannel surround System.This was done to capture the glory of the state of the art music mastered in the wide frequency response of 24/192kHz.Example ..Donald Fagen "Morph The Cat" dvd-audio disc..this dics captures the dedicated genuine glory of dvd-audio multichannel done superbly.Today we have the so call Bonus Dvd Audio disc packaged together for one low rediculous price only to be disappointed  with the amature quality of the 5.1 mix.If you are an audiophile like me and know the difference between the dedicated Dvd-audio disc sold between $14.99-$29.99 and the so call Bonus Dvd Disc...you will understand why iam so irritated at this new phenomenon.Today most good recievers can play back stereo recorded music in "all channel Stereo/multichannel stereo surround which sounds superior to the so call DVD 5.1 disc.The stereo version of the Beatles LOVE album is worthy of my expensive system and is highly recommended

I will state first off that I'm one of those hipster snobs who dismiss Pearl Jam's debut album, "Ten," as the whining chart-whoring pseudo-anthemizing overpriced-flannel-flying watered-down-grungifying crowd-surfer-pandering piffle that it is.  If you think that makes me inherently biased (unbalanced?) this review probably won't be "helpful" to you, and you can move on the other 250 or so reviews.  If you decide to hear me out, I promise to be fair, 'cause even though I may be a hipster snob, I can't deny to myself the sweet rockin' going on in "Vitalogy."

I love this Pretenders album and Chrissie always rocks but I love the songwriting skill of Billy Steinberg & Tom Kelley.  They wrote "Love Colours", "Night in my Veins" and the hit "Stand by You".  Her follow-up to this, "VIVA! EL AMOR!" also contains three tracks written by them.  I purchased this long after its release and was glad I did.  Steinberg Kelley write memorable hooks and good lyrics with interesting chord changes.  Something not all big names can do on their own and Chrissie wisely is aware of this.

This cd has so much going on and going for it - it's one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans.  Lee Ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the west coast evolutions in jazz during the 80's and you can hear why people followed his flavor on these tracks.  He's never sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this cd are tight and magnificent in their own right.

Feinstein is in love with the Gershwins and that passion is never made clearer than in Pure Gershwin.  Michael's love affair with Ira's lyrics, his reckless abandon to the light-hearted spirit of the familiar -- and  lesser known --phrases, more than makes up for the less polished vocal  production in this early album.  In fact, it is that very element that  sells these songs as I've never heard them elsewhere.  Michael pulls out  all stops, embracing the less-than-lily-white additional verses of  &quot;Embraceable You&quot;, with the unbridled passion of a first time  lover.  His duet with Rosie Clooney arrouses my curiosity about the movie  in which this unknown number made its debut.  What a delightful approach  Michael demonstrates throughout....  Oh, to be that young and exuberant  about life, love and music again

Vision and Ecstasy
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
It would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the Mahler Eighth ever recorded; I believe it is. But it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something, because after experiencing this colossal achievement, the competition (including, alphabetically, Abbado, Bernstein, Chailly, Haitink, Horenstein, Kubelik, Nagano, Olson [Colorado Mahlerfest], Solti, and Tennstedt, among others) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had. What sets this Mahler Eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy; of a transcendent vision being communicated, of a religious fervor. Mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work, such that he could bring us to the brink and say, "There. It's out there. You can't see it, but you can divine it" (and call "it" what you will: "God" or "Love" or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves). Most performances miss the mark, then, in one of two ways: by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand. The problem, of course, is that if we can understand it, it's no longer a vision, it's something mundane. In the closing pages of Wit's extraordinary (and that word, as well as any other, hardly begins to do it justice) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension. You know it's there only because you're willing to take that leap of faith. And that's what I mean when I say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor. There is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion I'm referring to here.

If you would have told me last year that I would own an album of piano solos I probably would have laughed in your face. While I enjoy several kinds of music, most of my favorites are in the classic rock and alternative genres. The reason I bought this is my wife and I are having a baby in December and our birthing class instructor played and reccomended Brickman as a popular choice for relaxation music and her personal favorite. I bought &quot;No Words&quot; and &quot;Simple Things&quot; mainly for their absence of singing and something to play while she is in labor. I have been listening to them nearly every night since we received them while browsing the internet or doing chores around the house. It really is amazing music that is very calming and relaxing. He definitely pours everything he has into his piano and the accompanying instruments and background is fabulous. Everything everyone else has stated in their reviews is right on as well. I would definitely reccomend not only this CD but Jim Brickman in general if you are looking for a nice relaxing getaway

this album is a great representation of what spoon is about. great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one's ears. spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well. they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting. some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind, the two sides of monsieur valentine, sister jack and i turn my camera on. i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock. definately money well spent

First Tribe Classic
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This was the second tribe album i bought i was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they didn't have it at the best buy i went to. I like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip. Most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot. All like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein, afterhours, foot prints, i left my wallet in el segundo, bonita applebum, can i kick it, rhythm, go ahead in the rain, and description of a fool. Man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable. I wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd. The only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs. This is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics.

The sounds were very convincing, I actually felt like I was there even my daughter thought it was really storming outside since I have a Subwoofer and was able to control the thunder intensity (all this was at night) the only thing missing was the strobe light to add to the lightnig effect. It does relax you and allows you to destress. There are other types of stress management cd's out there but if you like the outdoors and your'e not able to get away then this is what may work for you.

But a good debut album. This is when I felt proud knowin Ja was from ny. No radio friendly s*** here just street for the most part. But i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you can't keep talkin about it, which is why i guess he changed his style. Now the subject i wanna hit. Has anyone noticed that guy named progressive? Why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture? And everytime I turn around its some damn rocker/junkie hippie. Last time i checked Rhythm and melody was part of music. I dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock. I'm tired of our music bein trashed. You know what im a go trash one of they "artist" right now

One of the Greatest Live Albums Out There
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This album is by far on the greatest recent live recordings.  Sheryl Crow demonstrates her influence and talent by putting on an all star show with some of the biggest names in music history.  Sheryl shines on her own, singing some of her great hits, but it's the duets that really make the album.  My least favorite has to be the Dixie Chicks just because I can't appreciate the country flare they bring to "Strong Enough" but it's still a great version.  Chrissie Hynde, one of the album's highlights, brings intense attitude to "If It Makes You Happy", still one of my favorite Sheryl songs.  Stevie Nicks remains Stevie Nicks, giving more than enough emotion and flare to her own "Gold Dust Woman."  Sarah McLachlan's usually soft voice comes out strong on "The Difficult Kind" and compliments Sheryl's quite nicely.  My favorite rendition has to be Eric Clapton and Sheryl together on Cream's "White Room", the rock-out moment on the album.  The show is complete when all the guests return to belt out Bob Dylan's "Tombstone Blues" and close the show with a definite BANG

I won't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended. Being that I never heard all of her albums, so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'. However for me, who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me. Some of the tracks I love, a couple I don't like at all and the rest I just like.

First of all Bob Dylan is certainly not for everyone. However, if his style is up your alley this is a classic. You can turn on the radio and hear all those classic songs of his like "lay lady lay" or "like a rolling stone" to name a couple. Planet Waves is the type of album where the sum of the songs come together wonderfully. This is probably my favorite Dylan album and I have all the "classics" like Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61 revisited. ect. I'd recommend this to any Dylan fan

Even though Gary Allen is a country singer, he rocks as an artist!  He has a vein of rock mixed in with his deep country voice.  This man's voice is so smooth, he could melt butter along with any woman's heart.  Guys will like him too, but he's a crooner, his ballads touch women (sigh!) and make men want to emulate him.  I enjoyed every song on this CD, but my personal favorites are: Tough little boys, and Songs about rain, both beg to be sang along with

I have seen Phantom on stage twice and regularly listen to this cast recording.  It is a different approach to the classic Leroux novel; one that is gentler and more romantic, but still intense and passionate.  The lyrics and music are excellent.

Are you a Strummer or a Clash fan?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
If you're a Strummer fan who is an historical completist then you'll want this disc.   Also, there are some really good tunes on here for anyone, particularly Joe's "Keys to Your Heart".  Some of the live material here is high quality and some is not.  This is likely not a CD you will listen to over and over again as you would artists who are fresh.  But, I'm just glad this finally appeared on disc as I've always wanted to hear it and as a Joe fanatic, I had to have it.  There's moments here that sound like a rough draft of JS and the Mescaleros, but also moments of pure rock 'n roll circa mid 70's with some great guitar solos.  If Joe had not been where UK punk started after this band there's no telling what he would have done but you can be sure he'd have kept playing in a band.  I'm a huge Clash and Strummer fan, but I rate this 4 stars more for its historical significance than for the actual quality and uniqueness of the content

I bought this out of a cut rack for $3.99. It sat in my CD tower for at least 5 years before I ever really listened to it.I couldn't stand the way it sounded over my stereo and I came close to trading it.I brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album.I really like the whole experience. I'm lucky I brought it up here-it was going nowhere at home but I'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones. I don't know anything about this band,I bought it on a whim,but I'd reccommend this album and I may follow up on this band

There is a reason why Styx was the first musical act to have 4 triple platinum albums in row!  Find out why. They are a unique band, with their own uncatagorizable style and sound.  Not hard rock, but can rock. Not pop, but catchy melodies and great three part harmony.  Not art rock, but themed concepts in their writing and dramatic tempo changes and crescendos in their music.  It is probably true that Lady was the first power ballad, though Styx was not credited for it.  Lady paved the way for other rock bands to showcase their softer sides.   Perhaps Styx was not always successful in their attempts, but they took chances artistically and musically and should be given props for doing so.  Every song on this CD is great; however the two that stand out for me are Too Much Time On My Hands and Suite Madame Blue.  Most people who have spent time in neighborhood bar will would likely agree that Too Much Time On My Hands is witty, funny, and true.   Suite Madame Blue a song which is a metaphor for the United States is simply One of the Greatest Rock Songs Ever!! The lyrics of Suite Madame Blue are as powerful as the music, and this song contains all the elements which made Styx great

this is quite a sharp turn from francine's previous album (40 on a fall day)... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble's work in poundcake, this time around it's quieter, subtler, sweeter and sadder. make no mistake, this is a break-up album. even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold, lonely, hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can.

I saw Midlake at festival recently and had never heard of them. The live set was strong enough to convince me to order some albums and I'm now a solid fan. The opening track, Roscoe, reminds me a bit of Adrian Belew, a bit of XTC and a whole lot of Midlake themselves. It's like suddenly realizing how Coldplay should sound. The music is layered and atmospheric with a bit of an eels feel. Midlake is definitely their own band, for all the influences I'm throwing out. They make the sort of music that feels old, like your favorite album you lost long ago. Try 'Roscoe' or 'Young Bride' for an indication of their style. If you like either of those, you need to buy the album.

Paul's best solo album

Everyone has their favorite Beatle. Some people love to complain about Paul's solo music, comparing it to John's. The fact is that each of the Beatles had their own style, and together they had a magical symbiosis. Separately they each pursued a solo career that simply solidified what we already knew.

I rarely write reviews, but I need to comment on how fantastic this compilation is.  I have a four-year-old and an eighteen-month-old, and this CD is in heavy rotation at our house.  My husband and I love the music at least as much as they do -- it's stylish and sets a great mood as we're making dinner and doing dishes.  The kids love it too, needless to say.  My four-year-old's favorites are Three Blind Mice (she loves when the farmer's wife squeaks that she'll give back the tails) and the final track by Peggy Lee (where she says the word *poop*, as in "party poop" -- endless laughter ensues).  Ella Fitzgerald's A-Tisket, A-Tasket and Chew, Chew Your Bubblegum are priceless.  All in all, I highly recommend this CD -- everyone will be happy to hear it again and again

Pinback BLOWS me away.  I consider my taste in music to be very diverse, with a tendency to love obscure indie rock-pop, from the last three decades (talk talk, split enz to elliot smith and death cab).  Pinback delivers some of the best, most consistent music I've heard in YEARS.  I started with Summer in Abaddon and was weak in the knees, then I acquired their debut album and could barely stand...and now, Blue Screen Life has about knocked the breath right out of me.  I haven't gotten through the entire back catalog because I can't stop listening to the three albums I have in my hands.  Words cannot express how fascinating this band is - intricate & complicated with a simple, straightforward delivery.  Their transitions are SICK.  They put their contemporaries (death cab, the shins, the killers) to SHAME.  I love all of the aforementioned bands, but Pinback slaughters them in delivering well conceived, perfectly executed, diversified albums that you can listen to from front to back, over & over.  How many albums can you say that about?  They are heavenly.  The standouts are XIY, Boo, Concrete Seconds, Bbtone, Prog, Pene... oh, screw it - every song is GREAT!

As a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music I was wary of a CD claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid. I need not have worried - Tim O'Brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys I've followed for some time. Not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs, are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions. There are superb performances all round, vocally from O'Brien with guests Paul Brady, Maura O'Connell, Kathhy Mattea, Del McCoury etc and musicians Altan, Frankie Gavin, Jerry Douglas, Earl Scruggs, Seamus Egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh, acoustic and vital, requiring no production gimmicks or effects. Standout songs for me personally are &quot;Mountaineer is Always Free&quot;, &quot;Lost Little Children&quot;, &quot;Wandering&quot; and &quot;John Riley&quot; although there is not a weak track on the CD. It is obvious that for Tim O'Brien this has been a labour of love. If you like acoustic music, from any tradition, either side of the Atlantic, you'll love it. Several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant

NWA was an original rap group and with that being said, this is definitely a must have album for rap lovers. Along with Public Enemy, NWA christened their genre with hard core lyrics and tight bass beats. Although I don't agree with some of their lyrics, one would not expect this white kid to fully understand their view on life. Anyways, buy this album, I recommend it. Keep it away from the kiddies though

Of course, no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that Dizzy could.  His trumpet can only be described as HOT, and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air.   This man's music has LIFE in it. Unfortunately, the REAL energy to Dizzy is in his Latin Jazz work, and a more complete compilation of that style would be the Compact Jazz series. Ken Burns' collection here is more versatile, but just not as lively as Dizzy's music can be.  Proceed with caution

While not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as Coldplay, Keane, and Pete Yorn, Travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound. This, their 2nd album, is the best of their music: melodic throughout, with catchy tunes, solid lyrics, and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'Sing' to the fade-out from 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song'.

I'm just listening to it again after several years...the melodies are intricate, the words are vivid and allusive, the range is astounding.  Graceland has a wonderful rock-style going on, but I really think this is my favorite.  I know a lot of non-Simon fans who love this one album.  It's just fantastic

Comparing Gogol Bordello and JUF is like comparing apples and oranges. I have seen Gogol live more times than I have fingers and toes to count on. When I bought JUF I did not expect to hear anything remotely resembling a Gogol album. This is a dancehall album. You like it or you don't, but just remember it is a side project. It does not make any sense to compare it to other Gogol albums.

This CD brings back memories of the early 60's when Vince Martin and Fred Neil played at The Flick , The Coffee House, and the Hootenanny here in Miami.  I've had the LP forever.  Now that I'm getting the CD, I can listen in my car and remember seeing them perform live

Sidney Bechet was one of the first real fathers of jazz. Burns puts together a great combination of early recordings. Jazz historions note Bechet as one of the only horn players that could keep up with Louis Armstrong. You have to include Bechet in your Jazz collection, and this one is as good as any

Great compilation of songs from Massive Attack, all of their singles plus new never release songs. The videos are great and their new single 'live with me' is a great song (very sad video though). Includes new version/remix of 'I want you' with madonna. The combo is great you can own ALL of the videos, is a lot of fun to see the videos from blue lines until 100th window from the 90s all the way to the new single, the changes in the way they used to make music videos. There's even the first video with Tricky).

I supposed I should not have been watching this movie when I was nine years old, but I remember seeing it several times via HBO. More importantly, my father bought the soundtrack and we used to listen to it over & over in the car. The songs stuck with me for years, and every know and then I'll hear something out of context and I'll be taken back to roadtrips with my family.  It's something that I won't think about for ages, but when I'm reminded of it, I can't believe I don't still have a copy of the soundtrack.

<text>

This soundtrack cd is the perfect compliment to the visionary film--Cater Burwells score is a pitch-perfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and blithe absurdity on display,with his sense of minimalist suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightly.Also an added bonus of the above-mentioned dream combination--Bartok's &quot;Allegro&quot;(I know diddly about classical music,but Bartok rocks!!),and a typically great Bjork song&quot;Amphibian&quot;(in two versions),that book-ends the album with an etherial,dream-like haze

One of the best bands out there!!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years Into Eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here!! I think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is Tim Roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful (ive learned some of their songs this way) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days. And the rest of this band has so much talent, Stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting. Plus jims drum work, how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers, he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well. This album plain rocks,  It should be known as these guys were on Gigantour and rocked there too. Be cool if them and annihilator went on tour.  I have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same!

The progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from Poland. These guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years. So what do we get for our money you ask, a band comprising of well-schooled musicians, incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time-passages into each song. There are a few scatterings of influences that aren't a major detraction from the overall mood of the album, namely Dream Theater, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Genesis and Anathema.

Back when Blondie was being hailed as the biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike, there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed Blondie as "bubblegum pop," and one group that would never have staying power. But I think it's been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh. Parallel Lines helped establish Blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success. This album is also the first where Debbie Harry's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet, vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next. The album made punk, pop, and disco shake hands, which was a method unheard of in 1978. Songs like "Hanging on the Telephone," "Picture This," "Pretty Baby," and "Sunday Girl," have become irresitable pop gems, while "I Know But I Don't Know," and "Fade Away & Radiate," featuring a terrific guitar lick by Robert Fripp, are punk-driven classics. Last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in "One Way or Another," and "Heart of Glass." And how has Debbie Harry played out as lead singer after all these years? As Rolling Stone stated when this album was ranked #140 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, "Madonna was surely watching."

I've always written how the American NOW compilations do not even come close to the British ones, and my opinion has not since changed. NOW 20's track list, however, is solid and pretty good for the American series. It has mostly good rap songs (which can be sometimes rare in this series), great rock songs, and not an overload of mediocrities. I'll go in depth.

There are plenty of reasons to get this Dead Album.  One is the fact that this is probably the best recorded Psychedelic CD of all time.  It was the first Rock album recorded on a 16 track.  In fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology.  The remaster is splendid.   Another good reason is the great bonus tracks.  Almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your SUV to the record store.  Can you dig it

This remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound, but the only way top hear Aoxomoxoa is to find a original W7 (Warner Brothers-Seven Arts) green label vinyl pressing. The CD features the 1971 remix (like the 1989 CD) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like Constanten's prepared backrounds on "What's Become Of The Baby", the extra drums and barbershop vocal on "Doin That Rag". St Stephen lost something in the remix as well. Anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on CD. No hidden goodies on this disc, but the bonus tracks are great

This album is simply one of the coolest things around, and when I listened to it, it inspired me to a similar project using the same 'weaving and zoning from place to place' kind of method. What this basically is, are field recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics from mostly Indian/Middle Eastern/Oriental festivals; they are then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice. You get Indian gamelan, mussette accordion, vocal choruses, foreign tongue talking, and psychadelic bagpipes all in one 33 minute track, and then some. It's very trippy, and it hints at some kind of endless dream where we flow from place to place without reason. Get this for your own good

Back in the 70's and 80's, I listened to a really great radio station, WSGS in Hazard, Kentucky. From my home in Flat Gap, Virginia, and anywhere in the region, it was well known that if you wanted real country music, you simply had to turn on WSGS. 100,000 watts of pure, monophonic country music. I'm not talking about the big hats of Nashville, or the gussied up ladies who pose as country singers these days. No, it was the real thing, including local and regional bluegrass, gospel, hiccup preachers, Loretta Lynn, Lefty Frizzel, Merle Haggard, Bill Monroe, Grandpa Jones, and countless others.

With all the recent praise heaped on Smile, Orange Crate Art still remains largely under-recognized and under-appreciated. Sure, Smile was supposed to be this grand Copelandesque landscape of America, from Plymouth Rock to The Grand Cooley Dam. But for my money Brian and Van Dyke Parks did it so much better with Orange Crate Art. Having written, what everyone unanimously agrees to be the most California of all anthems, Fun Fun Fun, I Get Around and California Girls, Brian turns his attention to a California not of Hot Rods and Surf, but of sun drenched valleys rich with citrus and vine. Here Wilson and Parks celebrate and pay homage to the likes of Jack London and John Steinbeck. And if all this were not enough, we're treated to My Hobo Heart, a latter day Van Dyke Parks / Michael Hazelwood masterpiece. There's also the lovely Palm Tree & Moon, a dreamy little ode to a moonlit beach, territory not unfamiliar to Brian. And Summer In Monteray is so unabashedly nostalgic it would even make Clint Eastwood Blush. If you haven't become familiar with this so very underated collection yet, you really can't call yourself a Brian Wilson / Van Dyke Parks fan until you give this one a fair shot. You might even find yourself humming Sail Away or Hold Back Time while in the shower. I know I did

Classic Wynton--brilliant, clear trumpet renditions
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
For anyone who loves trumpet music as I do, this album is a must.  Wynton Marsalis has mastered twenty all-time favorite pieces with such brilliance, that no other trumpeteer comes near by comparison.  Opening with J. Clarke's, The King's March, Wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such baroque favorites as Purcell's Entrada from "The Indian Queen," J. Clark's The Prince of Denmark's March and J. Stanley's Trumpet Voluntary.  Fantastic selections from Bach, Mozart, and Haydn follow, with the album also including such delightful listening as The Last Rose of Summer, Carnival of Venisee, and Flight of the Bumblebee.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase

This album gives me goosebumps.  I got it because of Eric Dolphy, but there is a lot more to listen to on this album than Eric Dolphy alone (though he's excellent as usual).  The inclusion of Booker Ervin gives the album the perfect texture, as his style in many ways contradicts that of Dolphy. Although the styles are different, they complement each other perfectly.  Mal Waldron is a great composer, and many of his most excellent ideas appear on this album.  The song "Thirteen" is a fine example...you'll just have to listen to it.  Everyone on this album smokes.  Get this...you wont regret it

If you liked the original Clerks soundtrack, then you're sure to love this.  Thirteen years after we heard Randall and Dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first Clerks soundtrack, now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is, in fact, the REAL trilogy.  And we, the Clerks fans, get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track.

I am not Jewish, but you don't have to be to enjoy these songs. This album happens to be one of my favourites of the Putumayo releases. A couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though I thought I knew none of the songs when I bought this album. Each and every song on here is wonderful...some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions. The 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of Jewish music, and each artist has a page about them, including a photograph. I highly recommend this album to just about everyone. My husband is Arabic and he too loves these songs. Music truly is borderless

Faith at Her Best!
</Text>
</title>

I have only recently become a country music fan.  I wasn't sure I would like Faith Hill, but this was the first CD of hers I purchased.  From the very first song "This Kiss," I was instantly drawn into her music.  What I love about her songs is that they are so real.  "You Give Me Love" is so real and so strong.  It's nice to hear a song that a woman sings about a man who is crying for a change.  "The Secret of Life" has taken some getting used to.  It is not my absolute favorite on the CD.  "Me" is the song that means the most to me since I have experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship.  And "I Love You" is a heart-jerker for those who have loved someone from afar.  She has a big voice, and she nails each song on this CD.  Give it a try

This cd has alot of tight hits including: Nann by Trick Daddy and Who Dat' by J.T. Money. There are too many good songs to name for this cd, those are the biggest I like and I like all the others too. I can practically just  listen to the whole cd without stopping it, which usually never happens  with other cd's b/c u buy it for about 3 good songs and all the other songs  are junk. But this cd has all the Hip Hop Hits that it proclaims. I suggest  anyone looking at this review or cd, to buy the cd. It's worth it,  definetely!  One last word is that you will have no regrets buying this cd  at all I think in my own opinion.I am from St. Louie and I am telling ya'll  to look out for a new group called NELLY also, there hit single is already  out &quot;Country Grammar&quot; and cd soon to be out. Get that when it  comes out to. Peace out ya'll

Early Monk
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This disc dates from Monk's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for Columbia. So it's valuable from that point of view. It's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio Blue Note recordings that immediately preceded it. The best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended Blue Monk, which many consider the definitive version, and a lovely unaccompanied Just a Gigolo, which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as Alone in San Francisco. Sweet and Lovely is in a similarly reflective vein. Much of the rest of the album has a forceful, driving quality, with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for Monk. A particular highlight is Monk tearing through These Foolish Things

this is a very well done record by 3 of Raps most elite personalities.  Cube, Dub, & Mack definitely knew what they were doin when they made this record.  The beats are amazing on all the tracks.  This is one you can listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip button.  For me all these songs were hot from the first time i heard them.  If you're a fan of the whole West Coast gangsta rap thing, You GOTTA HAVE THIS!  My Fav tracks are "All the Critics in New York", "Do you like Criminals", "Gangsta's make the World go Round", "Westward Ho!", & "Hoo Bangin'"...although like i said, all the tracks are badass.  peac

Tosca's Suzuki is not breaking any ground, but by God they have mastered the art. This album is just so professional sounding, very nicely produced. This is how I envision trance to sound like, so much garbage out there it taked a while to sift through and find a golden little record like this. Funky bassbeats and killer sounds. It's what they call ethereal....I think. It flows so well from track to track, quite the odyessy in under an hour

Fournier plays exquisitely, imbuing each note with an elegance of its own and keeping the piece lyrical yet still rhythmically precise.  Although his interpretation is Romantic, the spirit is all Bach with no egoism on the part of Fournier.  There is both serenity and tension in these recordings, and Fournier's smooth interpretation is one of the most moving recordings available

Wow! I love this spykids movie way better than the first one. I think of the first one as an introduction for the characters and the sequel is the big adventure for all the Cortezes and even more characters, like the Giggleses. We met Donnagon in the first movie, and he was the reason for the Cortez parents to go on the mission. Now we see that he has kids and we relize that he has bigger plans for the OSS. And what about Alexandra, the preisidants daughter? She is the main reason we know about the transmooker device, right? Also grandma and grandpa Cortez are joining us in this movie. I think Robert Rodregiuz did an execallent job on the sequel, Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams. ... The sequel is awesome!!!!

Can't really add much to the reviews. This is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older. I'll admit that when this came out in '94, I only bumped the singles. It didn't grab me at the time. Sometime around '97 I gave it a spin and I've been loving it ever since. There are plenty of bangers on the album, but classics like "Pour Out A Little Liquor", "Str8 Ballin' ", "How Long Will They Mourn Me", Cradle To The Grave", and "Under Pressure" make this album worth owning all by themselves. The rest of the songs are on point too -- there isn't much filler on this album. The production is handled by Warren G. & Nate Dogg (1), the awesone yet underrated Easy Mo B (1), Johnny J (1), Jay & Mopreme (1), Jay & Syke (1), Stretch (1), and Thug Music (4). I'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks.

Winston/Guaraldi
</Text>

<Text>
MariaS and Srayle, if you like the Guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the Winston,  Personally, I think the Winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist' on Guaraldi's works.  The piano is brillaint sounding and at volume, thru a good system sounds like there's a piano in the room.  It should be emphatically understood, you are buying Winston in this case, and not Guaraldi.  I have both versions

Wonderful Christmas CD
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern Christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on CDs like this.  John Rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting.  The music overwhelms the senses and the joy of Christmas overcomes you as you listen.  This is one of the most peaceful Christmas CDs I have ever heard.  "Wassail Song" is incredible, and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble, this song is a must to perform.  You will not be disappointed when you purchase this CD

Wrathchild alone is worth the purchase of this album. Its just that darn good of a song. But hey, the whole album is good. the title track is brutally awesome, especially live on the beast over hammersmith cd (iron maiden box set). and murders in the rue morgue is another classic. then there is drifter, and the two intrumentals the ides of march and ghengis khan (who papa roach would rip off the guitar riff from for their one hit wonder song last resort). Maybe not as good as their debut album, but still a masterpeice of an album

Solid sountrack if you liked the movie
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This movie was a favorite in our household and my daughters always enjoyed the karaoke a the end of the DVD, so we searched for the soundtrack.  I actually chose this volume over volume 1 for two reasons...it contains the favorite from the movie, "I want to grow old with you" actually sung by Adam Sandler and secondly, because Volume 1 contains the song that Adam Sandler sings about his ex-girlfriend, which contains quite a bit of profanity, so I didn't want to get it for my kids.  I would have given it five stars, but we find the introduction by Billy Idol at the start of the last track, "I want to grow old with you," which is dialog from the movie, to be distracting and it gets tiring to have to listen to over and over when you just want to hear the song, which I mentioned was the absolute favorite

Visually and Emotionally Stunning
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am 62 years old, and seen them all.  I have NEVER seen anyone as visually and emotionally stunning as Beth Hart at the Paradiso!  Simply the most powerful stage performance I have ever witnessed!  She takes every single song to an epic level of entertainment, and just plain never coasts through a song. Some of the spectators in attendance looked almost scared by what they were seeing, and most were mesmerized by her on-stage and off stage sexually potent antics!  She has been compared to Janis.  I saw Janis twice, and Beth Hart would bury Janis in any category!  I can't imagine how she can possibly maintain a level like that captured at the Paradiso for very long--it just doesn't seem humanly possible!  I am so glad someone was there with so highly skilled a video crew to capture one of the most shattering evenings of music ever.  Magnificent in its fury!

I first heard this album in the late 6o's when it was originally released.  Starting with the first track, &quot;Blood of the Sun&quot;, I was hooked.  Leslie West was and has been a vastly unnoticed guitarist treasure. His  throaty singing and driving band, featuring Felix Pappalardi, made  this band one that should be placed on the list of &quot;great ones&quot;.  Probably due to the many other better publicized bands, like Led Zeppelin  and the like, Leslie West and Mountain seemed to get shoved away into the  closet. Open the closet, you guitarists out there, and give this CD a try.  I don't think you will be anything but delighte

Cab Calloway can't really have anything less than 5 stars

<text>
<Text>
Like Louis Jordan, his less well-known contemporary jump/jive artist, Cab Calloway fits into an area much beloved by Americans who recall the boggie woogie era or simply love the jumpin bumpin scufflin shufflin sound of that pre-rock and roll music. Though in truth I do love Jordan more and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather of R&amp;B, Calloway was the consumate showwman whose jive/jump music can't help but bring a smile to your lips and a lift to your heart

I have followed the Enigma project for a long time, and haven't found myself disappointed with a single release thus far. (That is, considering I am reviewing an older album.) 'The Cross of Changes,' the second chapter in the Enigma project, offers philosophical insight into Micheal Cr 's personal beliefs, in the form of an 'enigmatic' symphony of soft composition and chanson. While each album seems to hold it's own unique interpretation of life, I believe the purpose of this album is to inspire love, peace and wholeness within its listeners.

Sometimes, debut albums present an artist in full bloom, with an assured grasp on their sound and message. Sometimes, debut albums are nothing but promise, pointing toward what the artist could do. Public Enemy's gripping first album, Yo! Bum Rush the Show, manages to fill both categories: it's an expert, fully realized record of extraordinary power, but it pales in comparison with what came merely a year later. This is very much a Rick Rubin-directed production, kicking heavy guitars toward the front, honing the loops, rhythms, and samples into a roar with as much in common with rock as rap. But, damn if they don't sound like they've already conquered the world! Already, there is a tangible, physical excitement to the music, something that hits the gut with relentless force, as the mind races to keep up with Chuck's relentless rhymes or Flavor Flav's spastic outbursts. And if there doesn't seem to be as many classics here -- "You're Gonna Get Yours," "Miuzi Weighs a Ton," "Public Enemy No. 1" -- that's only in comparison to what came later, since by any other artist an album this furious, visceral, and exciting would unquestionably be heralded as a classic. From Public Enemy, this is simply a shade under classic status

What can you say about MFL that hasn't already been said. Sublime, perfect, classic. This is still the definitive recording of the show, and no one has ever come close to the original cast. Sadly, while the movie is wonderful, had Warner Bros. used Andrew's it might have been one of the greatest film musicals of all time. And while Audrey Hepburn gamely gives it her all, Andrew's had clearly made Eliza Doolittle her own, and she would have been uncomparable on film, and raised the level of the entire movie. Well, the rest is history, Andrews went on to be one of the biggest movie stars of the 60's.

A Taste Of Rory Gallagher
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Best of Taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. The albums consisted of two studio albums &quot;Taste&quot;, &quot;On The Boards, and the two live albums &quot;Live Taste&quot;, and &quot;Live At The Isle Of Wight&quot;.  This band was a power trio led by Rory Gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career.  The band led by Gallagher on vocals, guitar (electric, acoustic, &amp; slide), harmonica, and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock.  The music has much in common with Cream.  However, the Richard McCracken and John Wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  The undervalued Gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of Eric Clapton.  Like Cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like &quot;Sugar Mama&quot; and &quot;I Feel Good&quot; included here.  The music included here is varied.  It ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of &quot;Catfish&quot; to the more acoustic cover of &quot;Leavin' Blues&quot;.  The cuts from &quot;On The Boards&quot; become more jazzy at times.  Tracks like &quot;On The Boards&quot; and &quot;It's Happenened Before, It'll Happen Again&quot; highlight the band's more improvisational approach.  Hard hitting tracks like &quot;Eat My Words&quot; spotlight Gallagher's outstanding slide technique.  Two cuts I miss from this period which are not included here are &quot;Dual Carriageway Pain&quot; from &quot;Taste, and &quot;Morning Sun&quot; from &quot;On The Boards&quot;.  The live concert favorite &quot;Sinner Boy&quot; provides a bridge to Gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album &quot;Rory Gallagher&quot;.  This anthology provides a great overview of the early work of Irish blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster.  It is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports

Great album with an important message
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Its kind of hard to deny what Krs-One has brought to the game. His flow is phenomenal and the insight he gives is precious even now. Standout Tracks: DUCK DOWN, RUFF RUFF(dope match up with Freddie Foxx), 13 AND GOOD(the story of a guy who sleeps with a teen that calls her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitches), POISONOUS PRODUCTS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, LIKE A THROTTLE, WE IN HERE, THE REAL HOLY PLACE(the deepest track on here), WHO ARE THE PIMPS? and the reggae tinged joints like SAY GAL and SEX AND VIOLENCE are gems also. Filler: NONE! Bottom Line: BDP's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day. Besides the slammin production, Krs showed that he was 100 steps ahead from the average rapper with this album. Any born again hip hop head would do well to start off with Edutainment and work their way down to this album.

Can - 'Ege Bamyasi' (Mute)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Originally released in 1972,this was Can's fourth record as well as their follow-up to 'Tago Mago'(see my review).Some really superbly written and played cuts here to fully take in(might take several spins)are "Pinch",liked Michael Karoli's(R.I.P.)stellar guitar solos,the somewhat stunning "Vitamin C" and this reissue's lengthiest track,the ten-minute "Soup".First rate German progressive kraut.After I listened to this CD a second time,I realized that 'Ege Bamyasi' may have very well been a heavy influence on later bands like Gary Numan,Pere Ubu,Public Image Ltd. and Stereolab.Silly cover,don't you agree

So Dreamy, So Thick, So New... Kinda New
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I'll begin by saying this isn't the only "Ministry Of Sound Chillout Sessions" I've heard, in fact I love the MoS brand, so I can honestly say that EVERY single compilation has it's on flavour, from the "Clubber's Guide To" to "The Annual (Spring/ Summer/ Annual)" Which means, the previous and next instalments don't necesarily match this review. With that being said: This particular Compilation has a very elegant/ european/ underground feel to it. It's indie electronica and some rock-gone-acid-jazz, and of course, it wouldn't be European without some House music. It's fascinating that in the middle of an elephant-driven craze a song talking about taking a holiday so someone can love someone better starts to blend seamlessly. Yes, it's THAT type of record. It's not Pop, it's not a 'greatest hits' mash-up and it's definately not boring. I remember the first time I heard it (I was working graveyard shifts at that time) I'd listen to the first cd and it'd make me fall sound asleep after the first half. It's not a bad thing, it's just very relaxing, very soothing to the soul (Specially the Lior song "This Old Love", which helped me get through a rather painful breakup) Overall, it's THAT kind of session. It makes you think, it makes you apreciate it, it's a 'life soundtrack' from track 1 of the second disc ("we all live and die" from Kinda New) giving you a morning starter to the soothing track "Run (Jacknife Lee Remix)" on the first disc which invites you to THE promised dreamland. Nothing you'd expect from a regular MoS compilation, everything you'd expect from a really good chillout compilation. A MUST for any true Chillout Junkie

The performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful. This is the kind of material one can expect from Deutsche Grammophon. Wonderful music, a wonderful violinist, wonderful interpretations, and wonderful sound (not just for its time). There are also very few "squeaks" and he is almost always right on pitch! Often called definitive, this is the one to get. Highly recommended

The best voice in theater today

The only problem with Betty Buckley is that she isn't nearly as well known as she deserves to be, considering the length and quality of her career.  This album of somgs from her 1996 AIDS benefit concert at Carnegie Hall is simply flawless.  Naturally, it's heavy on music from Broadway, the London stage, and film scores, but she sings one Mary Chapin Carpenter song, &quot;Come On, Come On,&quot; that comes from none of those sources and is guaranteed to give you chills every time you hear it.  If you're tired of recordings by singers of little talent and less style, listen to Betty Buckley for fifteen minutes and you'll feel as if you'd never heard real singing before.  She is an original, and she has the best voice in theater of this or almost any decade

Of course if you get this CD you must get the companion CD Lux Aeterna by the Los Angeles Master Chorale.  You cannot have one without the other

Great bluegrass -- Excellent value
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
All-instrumental collections of bluegrass are hard to find, and if you like it when a band takes a break from singing and just plays their instruments, here's your chance for total immersion. All the songs on this compilation are from Rounder Records albums released 1976-1998, by artists with familiar names like Alison Krauss and Tony Rice, and others you may never have heard of.  All are first rate, foot stompin' renditions of bluegrass traditionals, with a few great originals -- Bill Monroe's &quot;Bluegrass Breakdown&quot; and Earl Scruggs' &quot;Foggy Mountain Chimes.&quot; Best known for most listeners is a rousing version of &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; by the Johnson Mountain Boys. If you like bluegrass with plenty of pickin' at breakneck speed, this CD will keep you smilin' through many, many replays

I really like this new singer, he has a style all of his own. I recently bought his new CD "A Swingin' Time" and I also had to have this, his first CD offered on Amazon. I'm really hooked on Monte Procopio's unique approach to these classic songs, can't wait for more

I never have understood how some people have an inate quality for music and some don't. Well , Willie was one of those that definately did. It is hard to imageine the blues without the likes of Willie Dixon: the writer, the musician, the producer, the businessman. I listen to his work over and over again , each time learning new nuances I did not hear before.

Iron Butterfly Live
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a "must-have" for all Iron Butterfly fans

This is, I believe, the best Fleetwood Mac album ever record by the band. It begins with a nice quick paced tune, "Second Hand News" and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there.

I don't know where this guy gets off saying that the drummer, Jorge Rossy, and the bassist, Larry Grenadier, &quot;are competent but do nothing overtly interesting&quot;.  Jorge incredible groove, use of space, and musicality is as good as one could ask for, and Grenadier's huge warm tone, amazing time, and great thematic development is unparalleled by other bassists of his generation

Along with Son Volt's &quot;Trace&quot; and Nadine's &quot;Downtown Saturday,&quot; this is one of the best rock albums of the 1990s and certainly one of the best alt.country albums ever released.  Standout  tracks include &quot;Blue Canoe,&quot; &quot;Soul Sister,&quot; &quot;Eyes  of a Child,&quot; &quot;Wink&quot; and &quot;Let's Go Runnin'&quot; all  examples of first class rock songwriting.  The rest ain't too shabby  either.  Fans of the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd in particular  should give this Mississippi band a listen.  But so should any mainstream  rock fan

This is Beck's coming of age album.  "Loser" was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and "Mellow Gold" landed Beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation.  His earlier recordings, featured in an album entitled "One Foot In The Grave," were evidence enough of his musical genius.

I bought this because I thought this cd would be nice to listen to in the car while on out and about. I love that our 2 1/2 year old daughter who is from China loves this cd and will request it "Chinese Flute" please. This is just one way to keep her heritage alive and expose her to different kinds of music beyond the Wiggles & Lilo & Stitch CD.

With Freddie backed by Herbie,Ron Carter,and Tony Williams.This is high-flight crisp and inspiring music.Worthy of repeated listenings. Listen and enjoy.Williams is over the top,very creative and will continue to suprise you with his unceasing inventiveness.I've  always noticed how Carter and Williams really spur Hancock on as you will notice in this set.Hancock,one the the truly great pianist of post-bop era,sounds like he is his having the time of his life.It doesn't get much better than this.

one of the Melvins best... (not that they ever made a bad one)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
this one came out in '91. its one of the very few albums that included the almighty Joe Preston on bass. one of the great things about this CD is that all the songs are all on one track. so it forces you to listen to this long, winding, sludgefest in its entirety. as most Melvins fans know, this (along with Houdini) was the pinacle of their musical career. after this, they made some great albums and some good ones, but never better than their self-titled album (previously titled "Lysol", but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit). it would be ultra-cool if Ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment. it definitely deserves it

If you're a fan of Latin music and especially Spanish guitar, you will LOVE Cafe Tropical.

Melody Meets Metal
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Few "metal" bands can successfully integrate melody into their music without falling back on the overused "power ballad". Tesla seems to be able to turn it on when needed, and shut it off when unnecessary. This debut from the Sacramento quintet is full of enough speed to satisfy any metalhead, yet also contains enough substance to satisfy those who want more from their rock than double kicks and 140 on the metronome.

The best soundtrack of all time
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
No doubt about it, from start to finish, this is a classic for anybody's collection. I can remember back in the spring of '93 when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today. This was rap music at it's best from Spice 1 to DJ Quik. There will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods. So add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap, west coast fan(like myself), or just want to hear a great soundtrack

Eddie's first all-studio recording, and the album that got me hooked.  I must say that even though they are uncomparably fantastic live, this album demonstrates the range and diversity of Eddie from Ohio.  &quot;Oh My  Brother&quot; is a particular favorite with Julie Murphy Wells displaying  her amazing range and beautiful voice, and Robbie Schaffer's talent for  emoting the absolute best of a heartwrenching situation.  If this song  doesn't touch your heart, you have no appreciation for music.  A particular  plus on this album is a beautiful violin solo of &quot;Yerushalyim Shel  Zahav&quot; by guest musician Pete Wilson on &quot;Jerusalem,&quot; another  song by Robbie, this time also performed by him.  As always, the amazing  prowess of this group is displayed magnificently

"Burnin'" was the last album by the Wailers as a collective group, afterwhich Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and Marley reformed his group, calling it "Bob Marley & the Wailers" in 1974.  The album shows the original three at their best, balancing lead vocals on several songs between Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Peter Tosh.  The album not only serves to further reveal Bob's soon-to-be legendary work, but also to show the talent of Bunny Wailer with his lead vocals on songs like "Hallelujah Time" and "Pass It On".

One of Ellington's best--elegance and excellence in innovation
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse is a groundbreaking suite, full of intriguing new sounds and grooves. Ellington didn't fade into predictability and mundanity in his last years; instead, his compositions became more and more original and exciting. This suite has rocking, swinging, waltzing grooves that, though seemingly disparate, work together and illustrate the theme stated in the Duke's spoken introduction to the suite: to show that "the whole world is going Oriental, and that no one will be able to retain his or her identity... not even the Orientals." Duke doesn't leave his standbys behind, though. The phenomenal playing of Ashby, Carney, Jones, and the rest of the Orchestra keeps The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse firmly rooted in virtuosity, even when playing to new grooves, melded with African, Asian, and Australian rhythm and sound.

The first time ever I saw this group "Amici forever" as they were singing "Unchained melody", I have confused that song like classical music. Because, it was very familiar. Actually, I didn't know exactly what's that song that moment. Finally, I knew that song is popular music I used to sing. So, laughed myself.

Not as epically gorgeous as 'Once Upon a Time in America', but still lovely.  There's a South American influence that lends a very fresh sound to the entire soundtrack.  My favourite track is an Ave Maria--in Guarani.  Haunting.  However, "Gabriel's Oboe" is the theme that makes this score.  Being an oboist, it of course holds a particular appeal to me--and the oboe performing the theme is really something to be aspired to

I got Secret Story as a Christmas present last year. I had asked for Imaginary Day, because the only tune I had heard from Pat Metheny was "The Roots of Coincidence," and I was itching for more. I still couldn't wait to hear what was on Secret Story, but I was hoping it would be in the same vain as The Roots of Coincidence. What I ended up hearing was an incredible CD with a vast scope, filled with emotions that change from tune to tune. Searching for tunes to sound like Roots was not successful; instead, I joyfully found a complete and very unique set.

It's a comforting kind of plain & It rocks. I played it in my cd player for about a month straight. The lead singers voice is unique. This band definitely has much potential to become a well known group. A great debut album.

Tears For Fears - Moral Lesson
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Tears for Fears was not the average 80's pop band, even if they looked like it on the surfice. They used synthsizers, drum machines with a meliodic and hook laden sound. But the music itself was often melancholy and they brought up serious issues like family values like few contemporary bands at the time had the guts to sing about. Tears for Fears got their name from Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy and they band consisted of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith, two highschool friends from Bath, England. Roland was the writer of most songs during the career while they both were co-singing. Some of the music may sound a little dated today (this being released in 1983) but the touchy subjects they bring up are still present today.

Sonny Please....thanks, and keep rollin!

I caught Sonny in a live performance this past November, so I got to hear at least 3 tracks off of his most current album...Sonny Please.  He opened the set with a fiery "Sonny Please" which smoked for a good 15 minutes (I believe that Victor Lewis was on traps that night so the percussion section helped do the driving).  For a man approaching 77 years of age, I was impressed with not only Sonny's playing and gracious presence, but his stamina in performing two 40 - 50 minute sets...trust me, the man can still play!   This album may not be another "Saxophone Colossus" or "The Bridge", but it is a solid recording and should satisfy a majority of Sonny's fans.  If you have no recorded music by this jazz legend, this CD is a respectable starting point

The first cd from Baby Anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare. I wouldn't claim that's a bad thing, but don't expect to be surprised if you're familiar with the genre. Overall it's a solid offering from Baby Anne and delivers the bass.

Darren Aronofsky's movies are beautiful masterpieces. From "Pi" to "The Fountain", going through "Requiem For a Dream", they will forever stand as timeless jewels. So they are hard to top in any way, but Clint Mansell has been able to do it every single time, scoring each of them.

Ballads to honkeytonk M C pulls  those heart strings
</Text>
</title>
<text>

This album has some of the best country songs in the business.  Mark sings songs straight from his heart.  There are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like &quot;Too cold at home&quot;, &quot;I'll think of  something else&quot;, and &quot;Almost goodbye&quot; to the fast, heels  kicking &quot;Bubba shot the jukebox&quot;, and &quot;Going through the big  'd'&quot;.  These songs are about real life realtionships  and how they  affect the heart. So if you're in the mood to cry about that lost love or  smile now that they're gone this is the album for you

Lou Donaldson still like usual funks away
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of Lou Donaldson. The album released on Blues Notes features Lou's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones. Lou even opts to 'chill' out on a  number called 'Over The Rainbow' but on other numbers like 'Donkey Walk'  Lou's style and also his unique band really shine. The unmistakable hammond  adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and  swinging drums this brings together another great album.Keep on funkin Mr  Lou Donaldson!!!!

Do I mean the best album or the best singer?  You are correct if you said both!  I saw Kristin Chenoweth on a PBS show "Broadway's Best at the Pops," (though it was not the first time I had heard her) and decided to check out the offerings here.  This is a collection of the kind of music and performances I love.  She has a great range, a precise pitch, and a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to herself. In an era when singers try to outdo each other re-interpreting the composer's original work, not usually with great success, she is a blessing

The Best R&B Band Ever!!! I know some will disagree with me, but this is the band that really rock my boat. I mean, they were awesome and it wasn't forced or fake.

Like it says in the ("33 1/3") liner notes: "...world class chops and originality".  If jazz is your bag and guitar licks get your attention, these tracks will set off fireworks!

Clevenger-ok, Baumann-awesome
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Hermann Baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd. I don't think that there is recording of the Haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance, even better than Tuckwell's. The cadenzas are absolutely awesome. I haven't listened to the Rosetti before but Baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well. Clevenger plays ok on the Haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy. I'm a saxophone player but I can recognize  true musicianship when I hear it and Baumann certainly is a brilliant musician. Highly recommended

This is one of the truly great Handel opera recordings of the last twenty years. As usual, Nicholas McGegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest Handelian conductors of our time. The singing from beginning to end is first class. This opera is known for the famous largo "Ombra mai fu," but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight

Cooperating with the times
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
While Photek was (and still is) reknowned for his minimalist approach to breakbeats and electronic sound, his approach changes significantly on &quot;Solaris.&quot; Starting off with the first three tracks, his beats still retain some of the stattacco nature of his earlier work (especially on &quot;Modus Operandi&quot;), but sound more full, more resonant. The tracks where he wanders into the realm of House were quite repeditive, and despite Robert Owen's wonderful efforts (first time I've heard him), they were lacking. The best track on the album, and one of the best Photek works is definitely &quot;Infinity.&quot; The rumbling bass really cuts right to the core, and reminds me a little of Source Direct. The trip-hop efforts are good for his first attempt at such music, but the more ethereal &quot;Halogen&quot; left an impression. A wash of sound that previously Parkes would be itching to rip apart with a snare roll, it comes off much better for the lack of any true form. Not a great album, but solid and indicative of where Photek would like to go in terms of his future works

Link this CD of great melodies with  "The Best of The Browns (1954-1967).  You'll not regreat the quality.  Such easy listening.  This group is simply the best.  I also suggest reading Maxine Brown's book "Looking Back to See, A country Music Memoir."  It's a well written (and interesting) cover of the the history of The Browns

As a kid, Out Of The Blue was one of the first albums (actually, 8-track) I paid for.  That decision was made after hearing "Sweet Talking Woman" as a single, and after I bought it, the album grew and grew with me.  Every few weeks, a different set of songs stuck with me as memorable.  The first few weeks, it was "Sweet Talking Woman," "Turn To Stone," and "Mr. Blue Sky" (all pop perfection); the next few weeks, it was "Wild West Hero," "Across The Border," and "Jungle."  After three months, there wasn't a corner or edge of the album I didn't know and like.

The title track is one of the best country songs ever performed proving the talents of Hank as a true caftsman when it comes to song writing. Fitting that category as well are Outlaw Women, and Women I've Never Had. Hank also lends his southern rockin' style to White Lightnin' written by J.P. Richardson a.k.a. the big bopper.  What Bocephus album would be complete without at least one tribute to his father? Hank serves up a whopper here along with Waylon Jennings in a classic called The Conversation.  In a time, much like today, when country was straying from it's roots Hank finds a way to keep the southern bluesy traditions alive on all ten cuts of this must have country album

what Schonn is all about.........and a little extra to boot..
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
people, what a killer release this is. i bought it in '92 when it was released, not knowing what to expect, as i had never heard a single cut from it. i knew Schonn was the axeman on this baby, and that was all i needed to know. i popped this cd in the player, and was instantly floored. what great melodic, poweful tunes filled my ears. i'm not much of a ballad fan, but even those are great. Dean Castronova on drums was the perfect choice for this type of release, as he adds the power to Schonn's precision. this is how Neal would have played with journey, had the suits let him do so. the Gioeli brothers, unknown to me at the time, do a masterful job as well. it's such a shame that great bands make an album or two, and just fade away, ie. Lynch Mob, Badlands and these guys, to name a few. this release is far superior to their second offering, but that one is pretty tasty as well. i suggest paying the coin for this cd, as it's worth every penny. Hardline 2 will run you about twice as much, but imports often do. get 'em both if ya' can, but this one is the best of the 2. peace.

The Great Society--with an emphasis on "Great"!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Being quite the fan of Grace Slick, Jefferson Airplane, and other 60s groups, I bought this album only having heard two songs on it--"Daydream Nightmare" and "Outlaw Blues".  At first I was a little puzzled--The Great Society sounded different than any band I'd ever heard before.  After listening to it about two more times, I realized this uniqueness was a good thing!  They sound a little rougher than your average 60s band, and they were--Grace, her first husband, and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year.  The Great Society definitely isn't a band for everyone, but if you love interesting-sounding music, want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock, or are just curious about how Grace Slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of Jefferson Airplane, this is the band for you!

I agree with most of the reviewers that this band was very underated.great singing electric and acoustic guitar playing and great songs.why were songs like Natures Way and I Got A Line not huge hits?I Got A Line made the top 40 I think.Natures Way was a great acoustic ballad.also Nothing To Hide has a nice acoustic/electric section.also Mister Skin could of been a hit catchy.this band was better than a lot of the crap that came out in the late 1960's all the bad hippie bands of that era.as for the whole album I think it would get  five stars if it had some live tracks as bonus cuts,like a live I Got A line or Natures Way live hearing that live would of been fun. I heard samples on a live Spirit cd.a great unknown band that everyone should give a listen to and to remember what real musicians and songs were about in the old days

1990. It dosen't seem like that lond ago. When a barley known Mariah Carey stuns the world with a powerful 5 octave voice that hasen't been heard since Minnie Ripperton.

Starr, whom Mariah was a backup singer for at the time, gave Tommy Mottola a demo tape of her songs and the rest was history. Now about the album.

A 25 MIC CLASSIC
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This was one of the first Hiphop albums I ever purchased and I still listen to it today I think that krs's style was best suited to Primos production. Once he lost Primo (with the exception of a few albums) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly. krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack MCs that deserved it. This was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his BDP days as well as few musical/lyrical tricks up his sleeve This album along with any other BDP release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into Hiphop this was the era that I belive Hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now I wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper.

Gerry Beckley is "timeless". His new CD is awesome and seems to go back to his roots. His songs over the years last lifetimes and bring back amazing memories.This new CD just proves he hasnt lost his touch. Anyone who does not agree, doesnt know the real Gerry. I have had the privilege to meet him and talk with him many times, including being able to celebrate New Years eve with them after a concert with the rest of America and their families.He is one of the nicest people i have ever met, and his songs have always been a part of my life. I hope there are still many more CD's still to come and look forward to seeing him again in the near future in concert and afterwards

If you like the Beach Boys and appreciate the technical quality behind Telarc recordings, then this disc is a must have in your collection. First, Papa Doo Run Run does an excellent job covering Beach Boys tunes to the point where some people can't tell the difference, but you can still hear the uniqueness they bring to it. Second, you'll feel like your hearing parts of the music you've never heard before because there is so much more foundation and clarity to the recording. You can hear each instrument clearly. The beginning of &quot;I Get Around&quot; is almost explosive, they way the original recording should have been. Telarc and Papa Doo Run Run have made a special album here. When I feel like listening to the Beach Boys, I usually grab this CD first

Joe Bonamassa is a blue/rock musical phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time to listen to his music. In his musical style/class, I would count him the second greatest musician on the planet - with Walter Trout weighing in first place.  As you can easily see from all of the other reviews, I believe that you will find this CD well worth purchasing - as I have found all his material is. (After purchasing this item, I eventually went on to purchase everything he produced and haven't been disappointed.) As with any CD, you may not like all the selections but I believe the vast majority of his material you will. Among my favorites on this CD are: `Pack It Up', `You Upset Me Baby', and `Man of Many Words'. Bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician. Since he is young and gifted, we can expect many more superb CD's in the future. Highly recommended

In August 1969 five session singers were invited to form a new session group. Main singer was Tony Burrows of Ivy League and Flowerpot Men fame.

The rest of the songs are  a mix of songs from this second outfit 1974-1980. This outfit is still on  tour at the end of the centur

First off, to the above comments, while I thoroughly enjoyed your well articulated history lessons, and would be interested to read other history lessons from you, you have to realize that this story is not directly based off of the 300 Spartans at Thermopolye, but of the Graphic Novel. Now this is not to say that it is historily accurate in some sense, but the movie is tuned more to the direction of the graphic novell itself.

The Singing Brakeman !
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
"The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" is highly recommended for any serious country music fan. If anyone is the genuine article, it is Jimmie. Listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including "Frankie and Johnny", "Mule Skinner Blues" and "T for Texas".  There are also fine versions of "Waitin' for A Train" and "In the Jailhouse Now" though some may prefer Jerry Lee Lewis' version of the former and the Webb Pierce recording of the latter. The most interesting tracks are less well known.  These include "My Old Pal", "My Old Sunny South by the Sea" and one devoted not to a mother but a father (!)-"Daddy and Home". For this reviewer, the album hit its high point on the final track, a mournful "TB Blues", a reference to the disease that took Jimmie's life at 35. While Jimmie's yodeling style may not be for everyone, this reviewer considers this album a safe bet.  Keep in mind that JR was elected to both the Country and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Further, the "Essential" series of albums rarely disappoints. These almost always sponsor well- produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts. "The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" certainly falls into that category

Flyin Home Lionel!!

I have to tell you Lionel Hampton has yet to be matched in talent, and drive on the "phones." Funny Story, it was Tito Puente the late and legendary " King of the Mambo" was the one who showed Lionel (by carefull persuation) the light of the "phones" and shuned him away from the piano. Unfortunatly not much was known on this subject of the two meeting but I believe they meet in the service or right after Tito was discharged for WW II. I can tell you Lionel, to me, is best know for His BIG version of "Flying Home". A bigger, badder version of the small groups version he did with Benny Goodman, and teddy wilson. Lionels closest match would have to be Red Narrvo form the 1930's, but still Mr. Hampton 's drive and moves on the stage has yet to be matched

A super introduction to Bach
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
For someone who knows little about Bach and wants to learn something, you couldn't do better than to give them this CD.  Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra give their signature warm, plush sound to the work of the great Johann Sebastian Bach, making him sound very nearly like a Romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer.  This is not a bad thing--some complain that Bach, with his mathematical leanings, leaves them cold.  That isn't possible with the inviting material on this CD

I have to say I was getting worried that John Adams was becoming a has-been.  El Nino's first half was much better than the second, I didn't particularly like Transmigration and I defy anyone to listen to his 2001 piano work American Berserk and tell me it's any good.  But after this release, I stand humbly corrected -- he's still, in my opinion, America's, if not the world's, best living composer.

Ace rolls out its second volume of early girl and girl-led group sounds.  This time, there are six tunes that did not make it into the top 100 and that may seem to be a bit of a letdown in content but when looking at the overall repertoire, this series still beats just about anything else of the genre out there.  With enough (ten) top-10 songs to keep the music familiar, there are lots of seldom-found sides making the listening much more interesting and not sounding like every other oldies comp.  Between such monster hits as Lesley Gore's pre-womens' rights anthem &quot;You Don't Own Me&quot;, the Exciters go-and-get-him &quot;Tell Him&quot; and Kathy Young's barely pubescent &quot;A Thousand Stars&quot; are cradled such rarities as the Secrets' &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot; (a Madara-White, of &quot;You Don't Own Me&quot; and other Gore tunes fame, composition ), April Stevens' &quot;Teach Me Tiger&quot; (later with brother Nino Tempo striking it big with &quot;Deep Purple&quot;) and Timi Yuro's (of &quot;Hurt&quot; fame) &quot;What's A Matter Baby&quot;.  In this volume three of the tracks are acknowledged as having been lifted from disc but only track 10 is of substandard sound quality even so.  Many of the tracks (2,3,6,8,12-15,17,23,25,28) appear in stereo, the remainder in mono.  The 16-page booklet accompaning the disc provides pages of fascinating backround to the artists represented.  Ace again hits the mark with this new compilation

Great score, but how about the acoustics?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Undoubtedly, Marnie belongs to the top list of Bernard Herrmann's best film scores, a wonderful musical image of Alfred Hitchcock's underrated movie. Written for small ensemble (strings, woods, harp and horns) Herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood, tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that Herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for Hitch. Joel McNeely's reading is simply stunning as ever, so is the performance, but I just don't like the overall acoustics on these Var  rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details. They simply are overheard in this muffled sound. This is far from ideal for recording a film score and I bet Herrmann would not have liked this! But, it's a great, great score

I am new to Ron Sexsmith. Where have I been? This Cd is outstanding and so soothing.... The instrumentals are soul syrup, the melodies are whipped cream and the lyrics are full of cherries, nuts and fudge sauce.....It is putting something so sweet and so nurturing into the hearts and minds of the hungry and starving. I am still in the stage where his songs resonate in my mind just before I fall asleep at night and that waking up means I get to hear his "comfort food" again.... This honeymoon will last forever....  Fall in love folks, it's worth the risk....Calorie free, I promise...Thanks Ron, God Speed !

I am realtively new to country music. I purchased this because I had the pleasure of hearing Willie sing "You Don't Know Me" on CMT one afternoon. I was quite taken with his rendition and recalled hearing this song growing up. From this one time "soft rocker" I couldn't be happier. Go Willie

This will be short.  It is worth the price of this album just to hear the Branford and Harry Connick Jr. duet Carolina Shout.  That being said, all of the other tracks on this album are excellent. From Jungle Blues to Doug Wamble's solo guitar on Autumn Lamp, with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for Romare Breaden's art.  A must have.  Branford keeps outdoing himself

Solid 6th solo album from Cube
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Ice Cube is back for his 6th solo with the Peace Disc.  This may be my favorite album from Cube (close with "Lethal Injection").  His lyrics are much different then his first few albums and the beats changed with tthe times but it's still nice to hear from Cube.  With 13 songs, none ar ebad, 5 are ok, 1 is almost a classic and the rest are good.  Guests are on 4 songs so you still get enough Cube to satisfy you.  Production is decent as well, Chuckey Thompson & One Eye each do 3 songs, Puff Daddy, Younglord, Bud'da, Battlecat, Dr. Dre, T-Bone and Charley Bear all do 1 song.  A must have album for fans of Ice Cube.

I hesitated for so long to get this.  Having followed Moby's rise since circa 1994 it has been amazing to watch what an impact he has had on music and on various cultural media over the years.  I like his early techno/rave stuff and have enjoyed the gift he has for using electronica to score some beautiful and haunting hymns.  But I wondered: has Moby gone soft?  has he sold out?  I was pleasantly surprised.

"Animal Farm" is a personal favorite of mine. And I dont understand why this song does't get more recognition - in my opinion, the most underrated song ever written (yes i know, its a bold statement). Theres something about Davies' voice in "Animal Farm" that makes this song unforgettable - particularly in this part:

Supergrass are following the Beatles path into the new millenium...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
...yes, the Beatles by which I'm not comparing Supergrass to them. No, Supergrass are riding the road built by not only The Beatles, but other British rock'n'roll greats like The Kinks, David Bowie, The Zombies and many others. But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000's. This will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990's and 2000's, and without doubt represent the Bohemia-Intellectual-Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since Circa-Sgt. Pepper. An intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for anyone any age.

When I bought this cd I did not know that much about supergrass.  The only songs I had even heard were "pumping on the stereo" and "sun hits the sky" and I liked both of these songs a lot.  So while I was cruising the aisles in the record shop, my eyes caught a glimpse of Supergrass is 10, so I decided to buy it because it was at a great price, and I am glad I did.  The CD has not left my car since I bought it two months ago.

To start off i am a huge grateful dead fan and i have prabably about 150 cd's that cover many years of there carrer.  This release is very good and worth buying.  it has some great music on it and the price of the album is worth the eyes of the world with Branford Marsalis on the sax alone.  All and all this was among my first bunch of grateful dead cd's that i got and it got me hooked so do yourself a favor if you are thinking about listening to the grateful dead and you want to hear something from the 1990 era buy this cd.  But i would also get something from the 77 era too

Buy this CD now if you don't have it, it is an instant classic. The beats are banging, and fit Cougnut and C-Fresh's lyrics perfectly. The lyrics are tight, and touch on many different things. &quot;The Last Breath&quot; is real life song about death and injustice, and decisions we all have to make in life. &quot;Protect What You Hustle Fo&quot; is gangsta, about the individual struggle/hustle. &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot; (remix) is even better than the West Coast Bad Boyz version with Master P. Its about real life in the ghetto

While nothing in the film works very well except perhaps the chemistry  between Travolta and Stowe, the sublime soundtrack is another story. Descriptions such as "haunting" and  "soul moving" are right on the money,  one might also add ineffable to the list.

The Cleans best work
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Clean kick-started the illustrious New Zealand label Flying Nun in 1981, providing a key blueprint for indie-rockers from Australia (the Chills) to California (Pavement). Over this two-disc, 46-track set of rarities and essentials, the trio takes the chugga-chugga racket of the Velvet Underground and stretches it into an entire garage aesthetic of excited, rudimentary playing, shaky, Kiwi-accented vocals and endearing melodies. Disc one, as influential for the lo-fi sonics as for the songs, ends with the Clean's 1983 breakup. Disc two spans their 1988 reunion and 1996's Unknown Country, mining similar material with even more exciting (and even better-sounding) results. But by then, lots of bands were doing what the mighty Clean had helped pioneer.

Vet producer Don Was is aboard for this one and he pushes the Ladies to write some of their most mature material, relying on their trademark humour as a flavoring rather than a sole ingredient. The result is that even the radio tailored material is better than on "Stunt".

What a wonderful and diverse CD.  Sit in front of a fire on a rainy day with a nice glass of Oregon Pinot Noir in your hand.  Close your eyes relax and let the sounds of Liebert surround you.

Fusion of Musical Geniuses

This album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds.  The legendary Khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the Sufi music by playing more with his (brilliant) vocal skills then with the lyrics.  Micheal Brooks' music stands out and enhances the experience further.  This is not to say that the mainstream Indo-Paki audience won't enjoy this album ( This is one of my all time favs).  It is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus - for those who need music to do such things... :)

Better than the movie
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Despite the excellent screenplay by Sam Shepherd and the solid acting by Harry Dean Stanton, I found "Paris, Texas" a rather unimpressive film, and the only thing that kept it together for me was Cooder's astounding soundtrack. The music here is simple, yet very moving and even haunting. His guitar stylings really captured the mood and feel that the film was otherwise supposed to convey. It seems to seep right out of the desolate landscape of the Southwest. Every time I listen to this CD it reminds me of driving along some deserted highway in Nevada, SE California, etc. Also, it's really nice that the soundtrack contains the story ("I Knew These People") told by Stanton's character, since to me that was the best part of the movie. Even so, seeing "Paris, Texas" is not a prerequisite for enjoying this CD, the music is phenomenal in its own right

The first four albums are so unbelievably great that for me it's almost impossible to say one is better that the others. Taken together, they are almost like one long album. The Family That Plays Together shows the band turning a slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their artistic integrity. Their blending of styles is a bit mote intergrated than on the first. Randy California's influence on the music was becoming stronger as well. One thing that differd Spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch they were able to convey their songs in concert. I saw the original version 11 times and they never failed to astound me. It's a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band are of the later Ed Cassidy/Randy California version. Not that the later versions of the band weren't great - they just weren't quite as good as the original band. If your'e just being introduced to Spirit, The Family That Plays Together is a fine place to start

Eloy (name taken from H G Well`s Time Machine) is a German Atmospheric, Progressive Art Rock band that was formed back in 1969.

Their originator Frank Bornemann (guitars/vocals) has persevered, presiding over a three decade band, that has turned out some of the best progressive rock music, I've had the fortune to hear.

I remember hearing of this band when I was just a lad, but I never owned any of their albums, and none of my closest friends played this for me, so this is a great discovery for me. I'm only on my second listen, but it's already obvious to me that this is going to become a favorite. It's from my favorite rock period, the early seventies, and it's not only nicely remastered, it's also remixed, meaning they went back to the original multi-tracks, not the stereo master. I wish more reissues were done this way

This ain't your traditional dance album!

I recently decided to go through some of my old cds that I haven't listened toin ages. Dj Cheb i Sabbah's Maha Maya: Shri Durga Remixed&quot; was one of those cds that I came upon. This was my first exposure to Indian music, let alone world music. I wasn't really familiar with music outside of western culture. So this was a new experience for me. Listening to &quot;Maha Maya&quot; Shri Durga Remixed&quot; certainly takes the listener on a trip to India with its traditional Indian melodies. I envisioned myself in the Taj Mahal and watching a slew of belly dancers performing. The music took me awhile for the melodies to grow on me. It is certainly by no means your traditional dance remix album. I however dug Transglobal Underground's version of &quot;Kese Kese&quot; (Where's the Sarangi Mix&quot; right from the get go. It has a nice beat. Dj Cheb i Sabbah did a good job at mixing and making sure that the music flowed well together. I am definitely curious to hear dj Cheb's other cds now that I have re-discovered this little gem of a cd

A relentless tech mix that starts off with a bang.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This mix starts off heavy, and never lets up, with the quirky, yet hard hitting vocal track Grace (Anxiety) by Troy Pierce (as Louderbach) starting things off in a very energetic way.  This track worked well in Sascha Funke's Boogy Bytes 2 mix, but it was deep into the mix.  I feel it's even more effective starting a mix off.  Things quickly lighten up with the bloopy Claude VonStroke next, and then it's into the M.A.N.D.Y. remix of Tiefschwarz's excellent track Damage, featuring Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl on vocals.

As much as I hear time and again that "Mindcrime" was the Seattle quintet's finest, I always have to argue that this 1986 gem is the pinnacle of their career. While I was a big fan of Mindcrime and it's predecessor "The Warning", Rage For Order is QR's most consistent release and is mezmerising from start to finish. In a word.."perfect".

this is what music is all about, the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note, or the raspy, delicious vibrato of vocalist David Sylvian; it makes me melt and feel so good and pure. think if Tweaker were to make jazz--and really chill out--this is what it would sound like. you'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet, ever. there is everything one could want. possibly the perfect record. it's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul.

I'm not sure what took me so long to get it, but I'm just coming across this album.  It never made a blip on my radar I guess.  Anyway, I saw it at a local record store in the used bin for $2.00 and it was hardly used -- even the jewel case was flawless (it looked like it was only played once and then taken back to the store).  Obviously the owner before me didn't know what they had on their hands and the store manager didn't know either due to it's low price tag.  Balance is a must have album without question.  It came out in '03, I'm just getting it here in late '05 and it still sounds fresh.  There are so many bangers on this album that listing them would make this a five paragraph review.  Of the 16 joints (including the bonus track), I'd have to say that 14 of them are amazing.  Akrobatik rhymes with an honesty and realism that is rarely heard in rap (even amongst underground emcees).  The songs compliment and play off of each other without them all sounding the same.

A great series concept - highly significant artists performing material which taken individually or collectively represents a major section of the  American Music Library. Ofcourse the originally withdrawn [w. new  at-the-time Funky people] &quot;Talkin' Loud..&quot; by JB (I bought it  retail! ) is the highlight, along with the live  &quot;It's My  Thing...&quot; by Marva Whitney. (Yes, I saw MW sing it **l-i-v-e** at  Madison Square Garden in July, 1969). The prev. unrel. Bobby Byrd track and  Vicki Anderson's contribution to the &quot;Cold Sweat&quot; session also  reinforce the value for listeners

In 1976, MY FAIR LADY returned to Broadway, in a revival touted as the "20th Anniversary" production.  Perhaps most famously, this particular revival was the first big professional splash of a young soprano called Christine Andreas...

One of Bill Evans most beautiful recordings!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the Bill Evans trio. This was I'm told  Bill's first all ballads record. Riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962.  None of the music sounds dated. considering it's 41 years old. This is the first recording Bill made with Chuck Israels taking over for the late Scott Lafaro as the bass player. This album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it. The music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection. One goal that Bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and  original sounding jazz. I dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording. To me it sounds more like European classical music. Also thank god for Bill's college music theory teacher at Southeastern University Gretchen Magee.  Because if it werent for her motivation {Evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers} he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition "Very Early" {which is the last track on the CD its just breathtaking...}Being an amature pianist myself, "Very early" and "childrens play song" were the first two Evans' compositions I taught myself to play. The piece is a composition played in C major at a slow waltz tempo. He played the tune until the end of his life in 1980, but the original version on "moonbeams" might be the all around finest one.  It is given a very slow and delicate treatment, and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow  falling gently around you. I also really like his interpretation of "It might as well be spring". I think that Bill Evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that. He didnt play anything he didnt have to. He always played just the right amount of  notes and chords. With this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement. Evans once told Tony Bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on "truth and beauty." With the album "moonbeams" fans of Evans' music and important legacy will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life glowing from this gorgeous album. Highly recommended

Leo Kottke is a national treasure.  He is our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso.  Having said that, you'd expect his CDs to be at a very high level of brilliance.  I have at least a dozen of his titles.  If there is any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc, it's because there are so many Kottke releases to choose from.

And finding stories of stacks of old vinyls, dripping Yesterday and glowing Always.  Cali's finest, Madlib, is definitely one of the heirs of DJ Premiere, Pete Rock, DJ Quik and other previous beat konductas that helped established the sound of true hip-hop as a platform where old school soul and new school technique are amalgamated.  The latest Madlib Invasion is not for everybody; those of us who's butts were undeniably moved by Tribe's "Low End Theory" will definitely appreciate this endeavor.  Those of you who are tired of what MTV and other corporate entities and pass off as hip hop, clean out your crazy Uncle Otis's attic check out the Beat Konducta. Then walk down the street to Mr. Yancey's house, go into his basement and check out J Dilla's "Donuts.

</title>
<text>
<Text>
It's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that XTC's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70's first wave of British punk rock. Those were different times, after all. You couldn't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky-jerky, spastic wit of &quot;White Music&quot;. Come to think of it, not many people could make much sense of it back then, either. Andy Partridge's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than &quot;pop&quot;, and Barry Andrews' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song. Nevertheless, the album worked. It rocked in its own art-damaged way, and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation. That lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the Fab Four's &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; was cleverly appropriated for the intro to &quot;This Is Pop&quot;. A few songs later Dylan's &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia. There may have been more intense punk artifacts from the Class of '78, but not many were anywhere near as smart as &quot;White Music&quot;

I have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and I think it is superb!! I now know that the ALIEN movies rock! The tone of the music fits the movie. I especially like &quot; Ripleys Them&quot; Because it reflects on what has  happened with Ripley through-out the movie. The cloning, learing,  remebering and also meeting her clones. I would also like to say that the  movie was  excellent aswell. The cast did a great job, acting their hearts  out.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet should be proud of the music and his film.So if  you aren't an Alien fan, you sure as heck will be after you listen to the  soundtracks!               ~   Jenna

For hard-driving well-crafted rock-and-roll from the late 70s/early 80s, you can't do much better than Pat Benatar (and Heart) and this collection carries most -- but not all -- of the singles that dominated the airwaves for 4 years: Heart Breaker, Hit me With Your Best Shot, Love is a Battlefield, Fire and Ice, Promises in the Dark.  But no Benatar collection is complete without 'Treat Me Right', 'You Better Run', and 'I Want a Lover who won't drive me crazy' (superior, in my opinion, to the John Mellencamp version), especially if you prefer Benatar's hard-driving rockers to her slower ballads.

Which I suppose I'm not allowed to say, what with the worldwide phenomenon that was Songs From the Big Chair. But I think it's right. Roland took the opportunity following the breakup with Curt to make an aggressively postmodern record, and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on The Hurting always suggested.  Indeed, this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous reviewer noted, "Goodnight Song" has what has since become a familiar AOR sound. I call it the first "Coldplay" song, and it's fair to suggest that band would never exist without Tears For Fears.

Sixties R+B from Newcastle
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Animals, a group that included Eric Burdon and Alan Price, were the first major pop stars to emerge from Newcastle, a city located about 300 miles north of London, therefore far removed from where most talent scouts were searching. It is fortunate for us all that the Animals were discovered because they recorded some of the best R+B music to come of the UK in the sixties.

When this first was released I really wasn't expecting much. The last two releases Mega-Dave put out Risk, and the World Needs a Hero excluding the live Rude Awakening while certainly had some moments were 3 out of 5 material, but in defense they had to do what they to do to stay around. However, this album from the up tempo Blackmail the Universe, Kick the Chair which could have been on Rust In Peace, the Scorpion another return to form, and Back in the Day definitely were a few of the many highlights of this album. I wouldn't put this up there with Rust In Peace or Countdown, but I certainly would put this up there with So Far So Good or Youthansia actually this album kind of takes elements from those albums, and put's it into one. If your a new fan and just getting into Megadeth this isn't a bad place to start. Certainly a must have, and am looking forward to the brand new album next year. Long Live Mega-Dave

Quite different from his later big-band recordings. Some of the songs that you may find on Wes' 'BEST OF' collections sound too much like elevator music. Not so with this debut album. A drummer, a organist, and a guitar player; no horn section. Stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing. He shows of his trade mark octave playing, his chord solos (played over the organs rythm chords none the less), and flashy runs across the fret board when needed. A good CD to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz.

Five stars may be excessive if you judge this CD alongside the greatest classics, but when compared to similar CDs within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre, this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines.  I find myself coming back to this CD more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest.  The writing, while occasionally a bit awkward, is consistently interesting, honest and moving.  The themes of introspection, nostalgia,  regret, and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner.  The song "If I Were a Man" is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world; "Child of Steel" plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy; and "Take my Body" is a strong lament about the objectification of women.  I especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements; the simplicity really works with Ms. Cash's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments.  I've seen Ms. Cash perform live and, while she has other hits that may be more popular, this collection reveals her unique brilliance

Joni Mitchell tapping on Weather Report's sound
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Even though Mitchell wanted to feel reckless in this album, she accomplished one thing with her music: coming closer to Weather Report.  It's obvious she loved its jazz-fusion and admired Jaco Pastorious and Wayne Shorter so much to have invited them to reach their peaks, but as master musicians they could only achieved what Joni allowed them to do. In "Paprika Plains" (a song over 16 min. long) Joni unloads wonderful lyrics but only allows her group of pioneers to explode at the last two and half minutes. I would have hoped to hear a longer and more robust instrumental finish worthy of Weather Report's reputation.  Over all the album is interesting because Mitchell is not afraid of going out on a very tiny limb....

Yeah, Johnny must've been drinking heavily during this recording. It's evident in his slurred lyrics...It's Raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted, although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed. BUT  all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d.---- Johnny Winter really becomes the archetypal BLUESMAN on this c.d.  His guitar work is quite sparse, no long solos on this one but, nevertheless, the feel on this album is wonderful.   I have to say this also..Johnny must've been VERY, VERY brave to release this album back in 1977. That was a very bad year for the blues, appalling infact...disco music was king. Alot of bluesmen, like Johnny Guitar Watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor. Johnny might've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like Edgar was doing. Instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and I have to admire the determination and resolve of Johnny Winter. Very few would've stayed faithful to the blues.

A nice introduction to a little known artist
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
A friend of mine at work just recently introduced me to the music of Chris Rea via this very nice Best Of comp. He also recommended getting his Road To Hell cd. Both of these cd's were money well spent. I'm surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the 80's when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity, mainly due to his top 20 hit "Fool (If You Think It's Over)". For some reason I never equated that song with this artist. The thing I like most about Rea is his musical diversity. He can lay down a very memorable AM pop hit like "Fool" or "Let's Dance" and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like "Road To Hell". No matter what the genre of music, this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove. There's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd. "Auberge" and especially the wonderful "On The Beach" stuck out for me. But you get many styles here. And each song sets a different mood. From the easy listening "Winter Song" or the catchy "Looking For Summer". Or some excellent blues rock like "Road To Hell", "God's Great Banana Skin" or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off Rea's tasty slide guitar skills. I don't know how I missed this artist after all of these years. But I'm a new Rea fan who now looks forward to his next album. Whatever style that it might be, I'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb Best Of. This is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist. If your like me, after hearing this cd you'll probably want to search out some of his individual albums. I've since picked up his late 80's album "Dancing With Strangers". Another very nice cd. Most of the music on this Best Of cd is almost 20 years old, but it feels like it could have been written today. In other words it's well composed music that holds up very well over time. And I'm sure if your like me and not familiar with Rea's music, the minute you hear "Fool" or "On The Beach" it's going to bring the good part of the 80's back to you. Greatest hits cd's should all be this good. Highly recommended

Fresh For 1995 [4 Stars]
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I pretty much agree with EJ Rupert, but the good songs on this soundtrack are so strong that they make this album damn near classic all by themselves.  I gave this album 4 stars for that very reason.  Though it was never released as a single, "My Block" is one of Tupac's best songs (pre death row era is the best 'Pac in my opinion).  I don't think there's any question that every rap music fanatic recognizes Red and Meth's "How High" as an unquestionable classic (and this is the grimy version of How High....not the fluffy remix).  I still get open to that beat 11 years later.  Though it is somewhat formulaic, "Poppa Luv It" is still a dope cut from LL Cool J.  Bone Thugs N Harmony, Mary J. Blige, and  Onyx contribute "Everyday Thang", "Everday It Rains", and "Live!!" which show each artist in vintage form in my humble opinion.  Also, "Sowhatyousayin'" is the ideal west coast gangsta track in my mind.  Even when you get past those great tracks, you have other bangers like "Kill Dem All" [Kali Ranks], "Glamour & Glitz" [A Tribe Called Quest], and "Still Can't Fade It" [Warren G.] that still make for a great listening experience.  Hell, even The Dove Shack blew up on the strength of "Summertime In The LBC".  And the live version of Biggie's "Me & My B*tch" is definitely different from the studio version and it's great.  There's plenty to love about this album.

This is an awesome EP Slayer owns all even when the production isn't that great. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman shred fast as hell with their blazing fast riffs, Tom Araya's vocals are very hellish and gruesome and Dave Lombardo's drums are fast as well. This EP is Slayer at their prime and even if it's only four songs it's well worth the price. Below are my views on each song.

A perfect Appalachian honeymoon soundtrack
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
We bought this - on cassette - in Washington DC on our first day of honeymoon in September 1997. Having flown from Northern Ireland, it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from  Washington to Nashville, along the Skyline drive, down through South West  Virginia, across Eastern Kentucky to Berea, and down to Smoky Mountains  National Park in Tennessee. We are from an Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish  background, and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that  our forebears had settled in so many centuries before, bringing thier  fiddles and folk songs with them, creating what was the core of mountain  old-time music and bluegrass. From the Carter Family right through, every  song is a classic. You must buy this

Finest Music Ever Heard
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I heard this music on the excellent P B S Documentary: &quot;Liberty - the American Revolution&quot; and I knew I had to have it! It is the finest music I have heard, capturing the heart and soul of the American Revolution. The documentary &quot;Liberty&quot; was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving. So too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment. I love it! I could hardly wait to get it in the mail. It framed the documentary (which I also bought) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting. Superlatives fail me. This music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the American Revolution and then by listening to it apart. This is some of the most wonderful music I have ever heard. It reminds me of the genius of Aaron Copland who wrote the Applachian Spring and Rodeo suites

"Water, wind and fire...will take our spirits away"

</title>
<text>
<Text>
The music here frequently reminded me of Pagan's Mind with a touch of Porcupine Tree and flashes of Iron Maiden.  A fantastic mixture of 1970s Progressive rock bands such as Yes and Kansas molded with European-style Power Metal and Brazilian folk music.  While this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that don't quite mesh.  In actuality I give the CD 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired, sometimes flawed ambition.  But as an overall package, this Special Edition of "Temple of Shadows" is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus DVD holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog.  This is a great album filled with high quality Progressive Power Metal and a DVD concert that gives a taste of their other albums (not to mention it's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves, smiling throughout the show).  Highly recommended.

Great CD but they've done better

<Text>
Solas' previous CD &quot;Words That Remain&quot; is a classic in Irish traditional music and the loss of Karan Casey certainly affects their sound on this album. However, instrumentally they are incredibly strong and as inventive as ever and Deirdre Scanlon is a gifted singer with a wide range of styles. I don't think the choice of tracks is quite so strong but it is a powerful performance of a very high order of music. The instrumental playing at times leaves you breathless and the energy levels are very high. There are some lovely songs - i like &quot;Bonnie Mae&quot; and &quot;Miner's Life&quot; in particular and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; is an original gem. I am disappointed to hear critics complain of the lack of &quot;traditional&quot; music on the CD and about the use of &quot;rock&quot; instruments. Based on those criteria the only instruments tolerated would be harp, uillean pipes, wooden flute and fiddle (tin whistle (flageolet), guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, accordion and banjo being modern, foreign invaders)and what a pity! What defines traditional - is it pre-Planxty? Can no more traditional songs be written? Seamus Egan and Co have done their apprenticeship in the rigorous disciplines from the book of traditional music (rhythm and melody) and have enriched it with a new chapter. In general i agree that bass and percussion is often unnecessary but in this case the augmentations are tasteful and generally effective. I would also highly revcommend Liz Carroll's &quot;Lost in the Loop&quot; although if you're a purist it has the Solas rhythm section playing on it and features many of Liz's &quot;brand new&quot; traditional tunes (brilliant)

<text>

First off, I'd like to say that I am not a Country music fan, but I am a Johnny Cash fan. He transcends the genre that turned his back on him in his later years, but here the man can do no wrong. Now, I bought the 2000 "expansion" release of this concert which at the time was dubbed the "complete concert recording". It was misleading because I had seen the British documentary (the DVD of this is included in the set)in which Johnny &  friends were performing songs I never knew existed from this legendary event because they were absent on CD. Now this is the full sha-bang, complete with amazing packaging, the concert spread over two CDs, and the DVD mentioned above. If you bought the previous CD like I did, let me tell you, this is worth the upgrade as it seems this is the "definitive end to all release" of Johnny singing to the boys at San Quentin.

Mountain Music offers what Alabama is famous for, great music and great harmony all packaged together. The title cut is great, that harmonica and &quot;old man of the mountain&quot; intro is unique. As for &quot;Close Enough to Perfect&quot; if any man sings that song to his lady, she is his forever. The cuteness of &quot;Never Be One&quot; also reminds us of the sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardly know it. There isn't a bad song on the whole CD and will make a good addition to any collection

This is a wonderful view into what is the best and worst about a Tedeschi concert.  She can be as soulful as the best of the blues singers but it also exposes her weakness:  She just can't rock enough to provide the balance her act needs.  She's terrific on the ballads but isn't a good enough guitar player to hold up the guitar playing for a band so they have to make do with her fabulous vocals.  She's got solid keyboards and vocals in support, so it's not apparent until half way through the gig.  But keyboards can't provide enough of an edge to the very few fast, upbeat songs and the whole concert lags.  Zzzzz by 2/3rds of the way through.  Look at the audience at the end of the concert when she plays a lethargic version of "I Fell in Love."  Very few people (besides the B3 player who has kept the only energy up through the show) are energized.

"The Passion of the Christ - Songs" is a fine collection of great songs, each in their own way a reaction to the spectacular film that Mel Gibson has created. The standouts are the song "I See Love" by Steven Curtis Chapman, Third Day an MercyMe; Scott Stapp's powerful solo debut song "Relearn Love;" "Rainy Day" by Big Dismal, and the emotional "New Again" by Brad Paisley and Sarah Evans.  Despite a couple of songs that don't reach their true potential ("The Passion," and "How Many Lashes"), this is a fine CD that belongs in anyone's and everyone's Christian music collection. Grade: A-

Miss Saigon is my favorite all-time musical!  I was hesitant when buying this recording because in my mind Lea Salonga is and always will be Kim!  But I was pleasantly surprised.  Joanna Ampil as Kim holds her own.  While she doesn't have the vocal range of Lea, she has a beautiful, crisp voice which she uses to emote the emotional turmoil of Kim.  She expresses herself in a way that makes you feel her love, pain and anguish and in turn she makes this part her own.  The rest of the cast is superb (especially the amazing Ruthie Henshall as Ellen) but make no mistake, this show belongs to Ampil!

In many ways, this album is everything one would have expected-- somehow the natural successor to "No Pussyfooting" and "Evening Star".  In other ways, its nothing like I would have expected-- the usual stamps of Fripp and Eno's recent work seems to be missing.

Hands down, a 5 star, two thumbs up, classic joint.  After it dropped, Puba reigned supreeeme.  Disregard the Amazon reviewer, there are no "gaffes" in this one, period...  These guys were true to their beliefs.  They weren't packaging a product for "pop" consumption, they were telling a generation what THEY THOUGHT.  Check it out and the music will speak for itself.  The best track in my opinion was "Wake UP", but the whole album was great.  As someone else mentioned, fast tracks put it in the 90's but most of the tracks are relevant sound as good as ever.

The Last Roxy Music Album...

This is Roxys last gasp...I mean "wheres Eddie Jobson??" Actually this really a good recording, its just that the first 5 Roxy Music albums were so flawlessly perfect that its hard to stand up against that level of perfection...anyway..with that said...I have NO IDEA why they took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version of Angel Eyes, which is hard to find on CD. This, to me is really the last Roxy Music Album, because you just CANT have Roxy Music without Paul Thompson...sorry. I mean Avalon and the others are nice pieces, but they really should have been Bryan Ferry solo albums because Andy and Phil are really playing more as session players there

I wonder if the two reviewers who said they were disappointed in this soundtrack watched the film? My guess is that they did not. The film was ENHANCED by the James Horner score and it would have been hurt by anything that was not light and subtle. It is a unique and amazing film and the score is a perfect match. By the way, the bigwigs at Universal nearly died when they heard it and then were equally stunned when they asked Horner for the written score and he had to admit that none existed!

Great lyics and superb musicianship. I rate this five stars as I believe Gill is one of the best singer songwriters in the world today

Brilliant, glorious music--all of it, although I agree with those who have come to feel that the Ellington/Strayhorn version of &quot;The Nutcracker Suite,&quot; in particular, is an all-too-often-buried treasure that no Christmas season should be without (and if you can ignore it for the rest of the year, you have more willpower than I).  What happens to Tchaikovsky's marvellous music--and Grieg's, too--in these hands is creative homage of the highest order: the music is re-imagined from the inside, in wholly jazz terms, in a way that simultaneously illuminates and completely reconceives the original.  What Balanchine did for Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky in dance, Ellington here does for Tchaikovsky and Grieg in another realm of music, and leaves us with works that deserve to be every bit as loved and celebrated as their older and better-known prototypes.  And to top it all off, you get Ellington and Strayhorn's own superb &quot;Suite Thursday.&quot;  Listen and rejoice

This album has new meaning to me now in 2007, where I go to a college next to a high school, where I see a bunch of "punk rockers" spending lots of money to make sure their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered to maximize trendiness.  There are plenty of punk rock bands out there that keep the spirit of Social Distortion alive, but sometimes their music is hard to find, and all the posers you see start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire.  Albums like this exist for times like those.  Just stick it in, turn up the volume, and rock out

Basie's best players come to Duke's place, the Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in 1961 and face Ellington's finest. Not a battle, but not quite a merger, either, since the Count's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel. There's more than an hour of good music on here, laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras. Popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible. This is one of those rare CD's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music. This one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session, one of Ellington's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague. Also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics. Basie hated Columbia's first idea to bill the date as a competition, and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art. The end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name. The cover finally chosen says "The Count Meets the Duke" but in larger letters it declares "FIRST TIME!" and then adds "2 Great Orchestras" and finally states "Duke Ellington and Count Basie." The label Columbia/Sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says "Duke Ellington MEETS Count Basie" which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20's. If you already like both orchestras, you'll want to own this late career session. If you want an introduction to each group in its waning years,  the CD serves nicely for that, too. This disc really jives, so don't be expecting any ballads here

I get the sense that The Fleetwoods'body of recorded work isn't given the respect it deserves. Over the course of their career, the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet this collection, as good as it is, is pretty much all that's out there on cd, save for a few other compilations that cover much of the same ground. Rock and roll has always had a soft side and it's in this area that the Fleetwoods really shine. Their cover of Thomas Wayne's &quot;Tragedy&quot; is an evocative slice of 1961 teen angst-I can't put it any other way. Maybe that's the reason why the Fleetwoods are given short shrift today: they're the perfect embodiment of a (then)nascent teen culture's soft and gentle side.This collection features all of their hits, some well chosen album tracks and the original pre-overdub version of &quot;Come softly to me&quot;. If you like this recording, try looking for their original lps. (My personal favourite is the 1963 &quot;Goodnight my Love&quot; album.

I don't like this album as much as their earlier stuff. I have liked each release less than the previous, and this one falls right in line with that trend.

My first Monk album was Monk's Dream from Columbia.  I loved that album 15 years ago and had been searching for the same satisfaction from the multitude of Monk recordings from the Blue Note Years, Presitge, and Riverside.  What Monk's Dream offered that the prior work lacked, was production.  Raw, edgy, spontaneous ...yes all those recordings offered that.  But I longed for that sense of confidence, tightness and richness of sound Monk's Deream provided.  I found that in this set which makes sense since Monk's Dream came out of these sessions at Columbia.  So what if these are reworks of the old stuff...they sound just as new and gripping &quot;produced&quot; as they did in their earlier days without big money helping out.  WIll I throw out my older stuff and just play this? No chance..there is a time for polish and a time for purity

Unforgettable

What makes a voice distinctive and memorable? Nat (King )Cole I believe had the smoothest voice of any male singer. Clarity and a sureness in phrasing was also gifts of his. Aside from 'Unforgettable' the songs I best remember are 'Mona Lisa' and 'Nature Boy'. But this recording also includes originals of the 'Nat King Cole trio'. It also includes  the famous duet put together of 'Unforgettable' from his early version and his daughter Natalie Cole's recording made after he had passed on. That particular recording was a 'knockout' sentimental and beautiful.

I purchased my first Weill recordings in 1960, the off-broadway Threepenny Opera, and Lenya's Berlin Theater Songs. I have treasured them all my life. Lenya was, of course, incomparable, but Ute Lemper carries on her special genius. This new recording is as near a perfect realization of this unique masterpiece. John Mauceri gives the unique orchestration nuance that even Klemperer missed in his masterful Kleine Dreigroschenmusik. Every member of the cast, even the bit roles, is perfect in the characterization. Kollo is the first performer since Harald Paulsen (the origninal Mackie Messer) to bring all of the tradition of Viennese operetta to this music. He is a miracle. Macheath has subtle characteriztion hitherto unknown except from Paulsen. Most noteworthy is the Jenny of Milva. Two delightful bonuses in the recording: a reprise in Act 2 of Seerauber Jenny by Milva (the Jenny) and the inclusion of Lucy Brown's aria after the Jealousy duet. There is brief dialog before most pieces which  adds a dramatic integrity to the recording. I cannot find high enough praise for this new treasure

I admit when I listened to this album I was blown away by the powerful content of Kenny G's music. I was moved by the story line and also by the music that was used during  the movie. Kenny G's music is perfect for this kind of movie. Not only that it adds flavor to the movie by his sensual playing of saxophone but also adds mood to the entire show. This is the perfect soundtract for the movie Dying Young because it just simply shows the real mood in the movie

That Nigga's Crazy and Bicentennial Nigger both surpass this album in laughs, but it would still rank high if it wasn't for the poor sound quality--there's a few audience members who can be heard a lot more clearly  than Pryor himself half the time.  But some great classic bits, and believe  me you're never bored

This talented woman can sing anything. I really enjoyed this cd with the lights turned down and a glass of wine to relax after a very stressful day at work. Renee could definitely have another singing career outside of opera should she choose. Hearing her drop that gorgeous voice down one octave rivals the best chanteuses in the business - Cassandra Wilson, Nancy Wilson, Regina Belle, Sarah Vaughan, etc. This cd of different musical styles reminds me of Nina Simone and Cassandra Wilson, two great singers whom could interpret any song genre and make their versions special. I loved all the songs and the standouts here are "Haunted Heart", "River", "My One and Only Love", "My Cherie Amour", "Cancao do Amor", and Beatles "In My Life", and "Hard Times Come Again No More".

I can't believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album.  Not a lot of in between among the notices -- those that hate are mean and heartless.  Very hurtful.  Lousy counterpoint to her warmth.  I don't think they understand that she doesn't have to lose control to be meaningful and touching.  Take her as an original instead of as a mimic.  What do I hear?  I love her lush voice on this album and Fred Hersch's brilliant piano accompaniment.  Bill Frisell is very good, too.  I love jazz & pop as well as opera.  Ren?e Fleming can make it any of these genres. These songs are very much her own interpretation.  They are 'deeper' than what you've heard before.  Even if I prefer Nancy Wilson or Eva Cassidy singing "You've Changed," Ren?e Fleming sings it warmly and beautifully, in her own style, and very touching, too.  She's not carried by full orchestration, mostly just Fred and her.  I was going to write that "My One and Only Love" was especially good, but as the cd kept playing, I must say that they are all especially good.  Enjoy

A Maid Of Constant Talent &amp; Good Taste
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
When a young artist names her first two albums not &quot;Judy&quot; or &quot;Collins&quot; but &quot;A Maid Of Constant Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Golden Apples Of The Sun&quot;,you know she takes herself seriously.Originaly released in 1961. and 1962. their names were all I knew until I saw this CD recently.&quot;Who will buy this?&quot; I wondered just to see the only copy snatched right in front of me.The comparisons with first two Baez albums are inevitable (some songs were recorded by both) althought Collins shows much more passion and involment where Baez seemingly seduces herself with the beauty of her voice.On these early albums Collins is frighteningly devoted keeper of the flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain (to some ears,overpowering) seriousness,cleverly mellowed by inclusion of joyous &quot;O Daddy Be Gay&quot;,a cousin to her &quot;Grandfather&quot; recorded years later.Althought I honestly love these songs and listen only this CD for days,these early albums are today much more significant as seeds of Collins later trademarks (voice will soar much higher in the future,she slipped W.B.Yeats into traditional folk collection just to later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer) and as they were product of their Greenwich Village times,they may sound a bit dated to some modern ears.But they are still hauntingly beautiful to me,I waited their re-release for too long

Outsiders - 'Strange Things Are Happening' (RPM Records)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Excellent 24 track compilation of this surperb psychedelic Dutch band. Each tune was a single sometime between 1965-69. These guys are NOT to be confused with a U.S. band from the same era of the same name. Cuts that make this CD a true keeper are "Sun's Going Down", the tripping "Feel Like I Wanted To Cry", "Keep On Trying", the familiar sounding "Touch" and "Ballad Of John B". This is yet ANOTHER band I've heard at least one or two tracks on the Rhino release of 'Original Artyfacts: Nuggets II' 4-CD box set.Should appeal to fans of Pretty Things,Q65,early Beatles,Creation and The Action.A must-have

I put off buying this for many years.  Having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous, I didn't want to taint my perceptions of the Queen legacy.  So I ignored this album.  Then, one day, I was listening to Innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again.  I came here and read many positive reviews, so I took the plunge.  I came out the other side very content. The legacy had not been tainted.

Beluga from Georgia

<Text>
Ms. Melua is from Georgia.  Her voice is quite like the Swede, Lisa Ekdahl.  Neither has range or power; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse.  Both have musical partners.  In Ms. Melua's case it is Mike Batt who is to her what Nelson Riddle was to Linda Rondstadt, except that, in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching, he writes songs.  Most of this album are her and/or his songs.  They are well written and well treated.  They are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners.  Mr. Batt, among many other things, worked with Steeleye Span and Art Garfunkel long ago.

The Melvins at the pinnacle of their career
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Watching the Melvins evolve was extremely interesting and entertaining. They began as an unassuming punk band, and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70's rock into their sound. Then they stripped away any and all of the "punk" trappings and went for pure HEAVY. It all culminated with this record. It just doesn't get any heavier than 'Roman Bird Dog/Hung Bunny'. 'With Teeth', rumored to actually be written by Joe Preston, is one of my all time favorite Melvins songs. Speaking of Joe Preston, he was the by far best of the Melvins' 7000+ bassists they had over the years. Shame they got rid of him shortly after this album. As soon as they fired him, they went straight down the greased pole to mediocrity Hell. Bad karma. Thank God that rock bands record their music so that it isn't lost forever every time they make stupid decisions. The only song on this record which I don't like is the cover of Alice Cooper's 'The Ballad of Dwight Fry'. Thankfully they made up for it with a cover of Flipper's 'Sacrifice'.

When I bought this CD it was for a little bit of nostalgia - Those Were The Days.

If you liked Mary Hopkins then this is a fantastic selection of her music and well worth a place in your collection

All of the Isleys early work without the younger Isleys is just as good with them. But these early workouts are more raw-stripped down and pop-oriented. Ron Isley has a way of making country, and rock remakes sound like they were never before recorded. Not too many black artists can do that. To get a taste of the &quot;Real Isleys&quot; before the &quot;Mr. Biggs&quot; persona, get this with &quot;Get into something&quot;, and &quot;Givin' it back&quot

Julieta Venegas did it again. She scored an album that is not alternative in style, however it is very catchy pop music. Her melodies are perfect for a morning drive with the radio on. You can sing along and express day to day feelings. Julieta continues to use instruments I like such as the harmonica. And of course, Julietas nice character and her lovely behavior shine through in her public appearances. My personal favorite is "Me voy", a very positive song about a not so positive event, breaking-up. Keep up the good work, Julieta. Your songs are appreciated.

...heart-wrenching break-up with his girlfriend of 8 years, Elastica's Justine Frishmann.  13 is a dark record, produced by William Orbit.  Nearly every song is injected with despair, sorrow, bitterness, and an achy, heart-breaking sadness.  These moods are encompassed on such tracks as Tender, 1992, Battle, and the tear-jerking No Distance Left to Run.  Also included are the trip-hop masterpiece Trimm Trabb, the humourous Trailerpark and B.L.U.R.E.M.I., and Coxon and Albarn's co-written pop-masterpiece, Coffee and TV

This Album Changed My Life
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
It all started when I was a little kid and my dad gave me this album (he wasn't a fan, he probably picked it up with a crate of used records.)  It was one of my first exposures to rock and roll.  Nearly 30 years later I still own the original vinyl (the one that had the exploding fire extinguisher rooster album cover.)  I am glad to have it now on CD, the vinyl being about as scratched and pitted as can possibly be and still be remotely playable.  I dissent the reviewers who praise DuCann over Crane, for really, it IS after all Vincent Crane's project (Crane, also organist for Crazy World of Arthur Brown.)  A keyboard player myself I consider Crane one of my biggest influences and I hold great admiration for his playing.  DuCann and Hammond also deserve praise for their performances, but it should be painfully obvious who the star of an organ driven rock band is: Um, the audience ... er, no the organist!  Take a trip back in time and enjoy this classic work

This is such an good industrial album, that I was sitting and listening to it and all the adjectives that I wanted to use seemed not good enough. However, if I have to put one then it has to be these, brilliant, astounding, stupendous and awesome. This is probably one of the best industrial albums of all time. The first track is good and then it just gets better and better. In fact the first track is not as good as the other ones and could have been replaced with another track. The book-let is ok but the lyrics are missing, but still it is an important release since it showed that inudtrial bands are tallented muisicians and can sing. Minphaser, Life Line, Guna are some of the best made industrial tracks ever with the intricate layers of sounds, bets and samples. The keyboard sounds are constantly amazing and this is an album not to be missed if one likes industrial music

Adios Marks the real goodbye from KMFDM.  After they went on to do MDFMK which was decent and then they came back.  Attak, was really weak because it was all Sascha and Skold and though I like them both, the absence of Gunter Schulz and En Esch really made this album absent in itself.  WWIII though it is a better and pretty decent album, KMFDM is still a little less present.

My 8-month-old son and I listen to this CD every night, and by the Pachelbel Canon (track 7) he's usually sound asleep.  It is NOT ALL SYNTHESIZER.  The jacket clearly states that the "Music Box Orchestra" includes flute, piano, cello, percussion, english horn, and oboe.  As a musician, I am not offended by the "easy-listening" versions of these classics.  In fact, I enjoy them.  They introduce my son to the timeless melodies WITHOUT OVERSTIMULATING HIM at bedtime.  I find them relaxing too

This CD was well worth the wait!  It contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and not even heard on the radio in years.  I took one of the CDs out of the box, put it in the player, and within minutes my wife and I were dancing.  The sound quality, in my judgment is solid, the packaging is fun and creative, and the booklet containing the Cameo Parkway "story" was an interesting read.  There will always be arguments about stuff that was included and not included, but this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era.  What great fun to hear the Orlons, Chubby Checker, The Tymes, The Dovells, Bobby Rydell, and Dee Dee Sharp once again.

I can't say enough how great this album is. Grant Green was one of the most soulful jazz guitarists who ever graced the planet. His soloing on this CD is filled with beautiful melodicism matched with a bluesy grit that is such a pleasure to listen to. And for me as a guitarist it has been an encyclopedia of how to play blues from a jazz perspective. My favorites are &quot;Miss Ann's Tempo&quot; and &quot;Blues for Willarene&quot;. It is such a shame that he died so young and never collected his just due

I was introduced to Nitin through my cousin who lives in England. She saw him live in London and raved about it...so off I went in search of this artist. He was difficult to find; nonetheless I was determined. I am one of those people who love music from almost all genres, cultures and corners of the globe. In other words, I am not a radio-pop saccharine sweet loving music listener. I look for music that proposes thought (although I do believe even top 40 has its place) If you are looking for an album/artist that resonates emotion, along with a powerful subtlety check Nitin Sawhney out. You won't be disappointed.

This is Jeff Beck's best album.  A masterpiece of guitar work.  This is an all instrumental album that features what Jeff does best - play guitar.  The supporting band is excellent especially the drum work.  Production quality is excellent as well.  While I wouldn't consider JB a blues guitarist I would consider him one of the top 10 guitarist ever and this album show cases why.  A great companion album to Blow by Blow is Wired.  It's a shame that after Wired his record company made him go back to albums with vocals.  He has on a roll and at a level that he has rarely gotten back to. If you like guitar and can live without vocals buy this album. You will not be disappointed

Where Have All the Great Bands Gone?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Lead singer and co-founder David Gates was recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.  This album is one prime example of why.  David has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy, sensitive lyrics.   His last album was a country album called &quot;Love Is Always  Seventeen,&quot; which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country,  co-produced and performed with Billy Dean.  But back to this gem.   &quot;Guitar Man,&quot; and &quot;Aubrey&quot; were the big hits off of  this album, and they still stand the test of time.  &quot;Tecolote&quot; is  one of their most unusual departures, and still makes me laugh, while  enjoying its musicality and orignality.  &quot;Didn't Even Know Her  Name&quot; is a poignant lost love song; &quot;Welcome to the Music&quot;  is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to  what to expect.  Even Larry Knechtel gets in on the vocals with the  intriguing &quot;Picture in My Mind.&quot;  It's a great album---in fact,  there's not a bad &quot;Bread&quot; album out there!  Enjoy, and relive  those magical moments of the glorious seventies

Like many before me,this "blue" Beatles best-of served as my first,in-depth sampling of The Beatles' output from their post-'Revolver' era from early-1967 onward... You couldn't find a better 100+ minutes of music to listen to straight through than the superb 28 tracks that make up 'The Beatles 1967-1970'. I bought this initially back in the winter of 1988 (I was 18 at the time) on cassette,and it changed my life. True; the 2-cd version often retails at $34.00,which is a bit much,but the material contained is beyond priceless.. About the songs. The songs!! There's not a lame one among the batch of 28. What's even cooler is that -even as the songs unfurl chronologically- they pack a flow to rival any of anyone's favorite best-of albums... The flow of all 28 is remarkable... A fantastic mix of all their late '60's #1 hits as well as choice album cuts ("A Day In The Life","I Am The Walrus")... Seriously folks; anyone who is feeling the itch to discover The Beatles' later output should get this "blue" best-of first,then graduate onto the studio albums themselves.. That's what happened to me and I wound up (so far) buying all of the albums from 'Rubber Soul' (1965) onwards... This blue '1967-1970' never disappoints. Because the liner notes/inlay booklet doesn't tell you which album each track is culled from,I'll happily fill you in:

Sombre Romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre. It is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting. Its not what you would really consider to be a "religious" album but there are many undertones that help get the message across. This point being made very clear in "Museum of Iscariot" which talks of Jesus from Judas' point of view.

This is a great Movie Soundtrack!. I'm a PASSPORT Fan since I was a kid back in the 70's. I have all Klaus Doldinger's official releases with his Passport signature. Please go and look for this CD "Running In Real Time" from Passport and listen to track number 2: Auryn. Then go and get all his Passport releases (almost 20 CDs since the 70's). Then you will see why Klaus Doldinger is very creative

The Madness---And Genius---Of Syd
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
After leaving (or being dismissed from) Pink Floyd in 1968 due to his LSD use & erratic behaviour, singer/songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett re-emerged in 1970 with his debut solo album, "The Madcap Laughs." The album did not come easy, as Syd never fully recovered from his drug use, and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on "Madcap Laughs." Producer Malcolm Jones did what he could with Syd for about half of the album, before handing the production reigns over to Barrett's former Floyd mates Roger Waters & David Gilmour to finish the job. Throughout the album, bum notes are played, beats are missed, and Barrett sings off-key. And on the rocker songs, the session players (from the group The Soft Machine) sound like they are struggling to keep up with Syd, who could hit a rough patch at any moment. For any other artist, this would all be nothing short of disastrous. And YET....in the case of Syd Barrett, any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven. Why? Because Barrett's songs on "The Madcap Laughs" are all wonderfully written, and although Syd's voice and guitar-playing are obviously not in tip-top condition, you can plainly hear on this album that he's trying. He's really, really *trying* to do his best, and his efforts really do shine through. For every bum note there's a passage that Syd plays beautifully, for every missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule, and for every note that Syd sings off-key, there are many moments where his very distinctive, British voice is magical. And of course, there's Syd's lyrics. You may not know what all of them actually *mean*, really, but to my ears, they're still poetry. The rockers are still powerful ("No Good Trying," "No Man's Land," the rockabilly fun of "Here I Go," and the classic "Octopus"), and the softer numbers still have great beauty to them ("Terrapin," the passionate "Dark Globe," the effective "Golden Hair"---based on a James Joyce poem---and "Long Gone"). Even the more ragged numbers like "Feel" and "If It's In You," somehow still hang together quite well (amusingly, we even hear some brief banter from Syd in the middle of "If It's In You," as his voice goes wildly off the map, he stops playing, prepares for another take, and finally gets through the song). When all is said and done, "The Madcap Laughs," warts and all, is an excellent album. It is a flawed masterpiece, and it shows that Syd Barrett, even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this point, was still a genius musician.

Though I am only 33 years old, I grew up listening to Bob Wills.  Merle Haggard did a great job with this one (as he always does).  I got goose bumps listening to it.

Tame's music is all about the beat. It's what got me right from the start, a grinding, repetitious backbone to every song. Tame One rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery. Tame gets rid of the verse-hook standarda, periodically ad-libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing. Its an amazing album well worth purchasing.

I bought this CD before going to see MMW (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006.  I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website.  So I bought a ticket and wanted to get "Out Louder", which I knew they were going to play, to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it.  So I bought "End of the World" instead.  While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall funkiness of it all.

I cannot stop listening to the song I Saved The World Today.  The CD is worth the price for this song alone.  The whole CD is great though ... classic Eurythmics that sounds as great today as their earlier work.  Annie Lennox gets all the attention ... and she deserves every bit, but Dave Stewart certainly deserves as much.  They make a great team and this CD should have been given much more attention in the USA.  I hope they don't take so long to do another one

Boards of Canada at their fuzziest - Essential
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is an amazing EP - one of Boards of Canada's strongest to date. Honestly, I didn't enjoy Dayvan Cowboy that much on Campfire Headphase, but since it has been recontectualized on Trans Canada Highway, I'm a huge fan of the song. The new tracks are more like what one would typically expect from Boards of Canada. Warm, fuzzy, mellow, lush analogue synths and plenty of them! For those who weren't as taken with the newer BOC sound on Campfire Headphase, assuage your fears - this is definitely a return to the traditional sound. That's not to say though that this is a rehash of old material. One can hear bits and pieces of Geogaddi and such, but the overall feel is much closer to Music Has the Right to Children. To all Boards of Canada fans - buy this without hesitation. It doesn't matter what you thought of Campfire - this is quality.

Beyond Suede
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Those who liked Suede may be looking for more of the same from The Tears, but despite the obviously recognisable vocals from Brett, and the familiar wailing of Bernard's guitar, this marks a watershed in their repertoire. The most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been crafted as 'hits' (much more radio-friendly, and why not?). It's also a more mellow sound than Suede (there were fewer opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the Tears concert I attended). Another important difference is the guitar work, with Bernard soaring off into sonic highs not experienced since Reeves Gabrels and Tin Machine. Among the better songs are Apollo 13, Brave New Century, Refugees and Co-Star. Though Brett and Bernard are capable of better, this is a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised Suede-heads, and I recommend you turn it up loud

a couple of bad tracks, but definitely worth peepin

This is one of my favorites of 2004.  You got a seasoned vet of an MC rockin over some of the illest producers in underground hip hops beats(madlib, j-zone, dangermouse) and some pretty nice guest appearances.  I have a couple of complaints on this album though, like the song "Love Thang", the hook is wack and the beat is corny, another wack hook comes thru on the title track where you got Prince Po sounding Like Tonto from Lone Ranger chanting some indian ish, and on top of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like "and if the girl farts then she's a pooter"??? thats dumb.  One last complaint then i'm done hatin, but the chorus on Bump Bump is terrible, and i'm embarrased to bump bump that ish when i'm in my car because it sounds so wack, but Raekwon's verse takes me back to when Wu Tang was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90's, which more than makes up for the lackluster chorus.  Aside from those complaints you got a dope album, J-Zone hit this up with some of best beats i've ever heard from him.  So pick this up its definitely a good purchase

Many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career.  For Peter Gabriel, every album is an experiment.  Usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm; however, on Gabriel's fifth experiment, SO, the ex-Genesis frontman does the exact opposite.  Gabriel, beloved for always doing something different, decided on this album to play it safe - and for Gabriel, that is an experiment.  Previously he was a sort of cult performer, but on SO, Gabriel finally made it into the spotlight.  Big time.  SO was an immense success, peaking at number one on the Billboard Top 100, receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews (in 2003, So placed 187th on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time), and resulting in a sold-out tour.

The beginning
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Unless you frequented jazz clubs in Baltimore or Philly in the fall of 1955, this would have been your first exposure to the Miles Davis-John Coltrane collaboration (a few tracks recorded for Columbia, the label Miles would soon be joining exclusively, a few weeks before this session weren't issued until much later). Davis settled on Coltrane as his replacement for the departing Sonny Rollins almost by default - no one else fit the bill or new the book. That they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much (Davis was a hands-off leader, Coltrane wanted constant  input from Miles on his playing and music in general).

DAYS DAWNING, CRYING CLOWN, FANFARE ARE A FEW SUCH SONGS. A FEW SONGS FROM WIND OF CHANGE, SOMETHING'S HAPPENING, AND EVEN A COUPLE FROM HIS EARLY DAYS WITH THE HERD WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A SECOND SUCCESSFUL LIVE ALBUM RATHER THAN THE I'M IN YOU ALBUM WHICH WAS A TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT

I am a latecomer to the works of Chopin, unqualified to comment on Dinu Lipatti's technique and interpretation, but this recording gives an interesting framework to explore the waltzes. They are numbered 1 through 14 in order of opus publication, but on this disc Lipatti shuffles them to form a cycle of his own devising. There are four waltzes in the key of A flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across the recital. Contrast this to Alexandre Thaurad's CD where he clumps like-key waltzes into groups. (He also adds five more posthumous works.)

Live Alive is good enough to buy in my standered's.....I really think this was recorded poorly but the songs on it are really good if you play it in your car, or on bigger speakers so you can really hear everything much better. Their are many good songs included on this complination of live performence's spanning from performences from Montreux Jazz Festival, Austin Opera House,and the Dallas Starfest. This recordings are all from 85-through 86. Jimmie Vaughan appears on Willie The Wimp, Love Struck Baby, Look At Little Sister, and Change It playing guitar, and string bass. I think the worst song on the entire complination is Voodoo Chile(slight return) which is kind of weird for me to say because I think that was truely the best song Stevie Ray played live but in this case its not. Other than that I really think for what it is it's a average live performence.

From the manic whirlwind Prelude to the shocking Cake and Sodomy, Portrait of an American family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable. Cake and Sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures, Lunchbox is told with a twist of humor, Organ Grinder is pleasing vocally, Cyclops is addictingly wild, Get your gunn is catchy (if not overly insulting), Dope Hat is great and fierce, and My Monkey is hysterically enjoyable. Snake Eyes and Sissies is another winner, easy to get lost in. The rest all work to varying degrees, though not as appealing. Every song on this album is worth listening to, from fast paced and rock style to techno overload.

A Different magic

This album was released in the summer of '86 when Queen's radio airplay was at a rather low point in the U.S. and at a very high point in Europe.By now,the band had adventured into pop genres beyond rock,yet colouring their songs with their distinctive style of interpretation and playing.Here we find the gorgeous ballad ONE YEAR OF LOVE and the catchy FRIENDS WILL BE FRIENDS.The ominous anthem WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER and the Highlander themed PRINCES OF THE UNIVERSE are gems in this crown.The first two USA singles, the rocker ONE VISION (from Iron Eagle)and the danceable A KIND OF MAGIC barely cracked the US Top 40 in a decade when alternative music was preferred and classics were often overlooke

stephen stills "for what it's worth" is, of course, a classic song.

but not the only one you should get.  Make this a purchase, but get live/dead also because it has all different songs, and then look at other live releases.  The dead have a lot of good recordings, just pick and choose among them.  This one has become a staple of great dead songs in my collection.  It is amazing how many good songs they have, and how intimidating it seems to get their best stuff, but you can't go wrong with this release even though some people feel it isn't up to scratch

One of the best albums of the eighties
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I got the LP version of this album as a Christmas present in 1988. I immediately fell in love with it. She sings about issues such as unemployment and poverty which were rampant during the Reagan years ("Talkin about a Revolution", "Fast Car"). But she offered hope that things would get better as we approached the 90s, which they did. "Mountains O Things" was about the materialsim of the 80s. Other issues she covers are racism ("Across the Lines") and domestic abuse ("Behind the Wall"). Even though this album is almost 20 years old it does not sound dated, as the messages are just as relavent today as they were in 1988.

This is the type of music to sit down, relax, put on a pair of headphones and let it absorb your concious. From spacey sounding electronics to soft vocals over piano to heart pounding rhythms to skittering percussion...this is just a taste of what is Supersilent, and from what I hear it is all improvised which blows my head clean off. All this coming from someone who has never heard them before...talk about a great buy! Highly, highly recommended, I close my eyes, to awaken among the cosmos traveling without a tangible body, drunk with the infinite beauty, I sigh without a mouth and think..

Really, this is only worth 4 stars if you can appreciate all things cheesy. This is, of course, funny stuff. Really, it's the kind of music where you don't want other people to know you're listening to it, but oh my is it fun!

Strong Collection for One of Metal's Greats.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There have been innumerable Motorhead collections over the years, but this is one of the few that attempts to mix old with the new. On this collection, all the classics are present, and some newer material is thrown in as well. Unfortunately, there are some throw-away tracks, mainly the Girlscool and Headgirl tracks. (To be honest, these tracks are pretty much worthless.) Some live tracks are meshed in and fit well, and the newer songs help to add some variety to the old-scool stuff.

Aretha's voice, her style, delivery and interpretation of her music is incomparable. These songs are more than just classics; they're a songbook to millions of people's lives who grew up listening to her in the 60's and 70's as I did. They evolk memories of times that changed our world, and showed just how powerful and influential music could be for generations to come. There is not much that came before, and very little that came after these golden years for Aretha, that can compare to this treasury of her music. Sadly the Aretha Frankiln of 2007 pales in comparison to the Aretha Franklin of this time, who was truly and rightfully The Queen of Soul.

This 1989 debut album from this Texas sleaze metal outfit is chocked full of great vocals from Jason McMaster,catchy guitar riffs,and generally a collection of feel good tunes about getting drunk and having a good time.It fits quite nicely in my CD collection in the " D" column next to the Dirty Looks CD.I thought "Scared" was the best song on here along with the opener,"Teasin Pleasin" and "Queen of the Nile" but I liked all of them.The best way to describe Dangerous Toys is that it has a heavy Guns N Roses sound with a poppier edge to it.It's too bad they never made a good album after this one and Dangerous Toys would never get to this level again.If you want late 80's hard rock/metal without the spandex and the makeup,this debut album is highly recommended.Nothing fancy,just good old fashioned rock and roll

RICK "SHAQ" GOLDSTEIN SAYS: "COCO" IS "OK!" "OK!"
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This CD is well worth buying. But to you blues aficionado's who rely on Shaq's recommendations, let me put it in terms you'll understand. Coco is no SRV, or an Albert, or a Buddy. He's definitely a large step below them. But he is also not a lounge singer type like Smokin Joe Kubek, Lil Ed and the Blue Imperials, etc. Coco, is a large step above them. This CD seems to pick up steam with each song.  He shows his flexibility with different types of guitar playing on a number of songs. He performs a great ballad, with a Johnny Copeland, song (#6), that's 5 minutes and 59 seconds long. (I could have said 6 minutes, but Shaq don't fool around when it comes to da blues!) NEW, GOOD BLUES IS HARD TO FIND, and till "Jumping Joe" Bonamassa dedicates more of his recordings to true electric blues, this is one of the best of the last year, along with Walter Trout's "Full Circle"

I don't own this CD. I don't have to own it to review it, because this music is the soundtrack of my high school years. I lived this music. I listened to it while cruising the local shopping center indulging in - er - various activities. Half of the bands on this CD I had the privilege of seeing perform live in the 70s. THIS is what FM radio sounded like back then. Every single song on this CD was well known to me and my friends. Yes, even Black Oak Arkansas (hot and nasty!), Nazareth (get Hair of the Dog CD for more), and the Runaways (hot babes!). Oh, and I love the movie too. Party on, dudes

Since Sunset Boulevard is one of my favorite films, I bought the London cast album long before the musical came to America.  Patti LaPone is the ultimate Broadway star, having created the role of Evita. Her soaring versions of "As If We Never Said Goodbye", and "With One Look" are unmatched. Her power and vocal range soar! All of Norma's songs had to be drastically reduced in vocal range to accomodate Glen Close's lack of, (or nonexistent) singing ability. In fact, this DVD was unavailabe to the American market during the American run of the musical and was literally pulled from the shelves. Perhaps ALW didn't want the American audience to hear the masterwork of this production.  Kevin Anderson, a brilliant actor, does not have the operatic quality of Alan Cambell in the U.S. cast, but he portrayed Joe Gillis with far more guts and passion.  This is not for the lover's of Oklahoma of Showboat, but for lovers of more contemporary musicals, this one is perfect

this album was by far the bands most daring ablum. they went away from the classic INXS sound that made them superstars (Kick, X) and instead updated their sound to fit the time. like a previous reviewer noted, this was when grunge was becoming very popular in the US, and unfortunately, caused this album to go unnoticed for the most part. its sad too, cuz there are many solid tracks, inlcuding Heaven Sent (my favorite), Not Enough Time, Baby Dont Cry and Beautiful Girl. I have recently become a big fan of INXS and have purchased all of their albums. I like this one in particular because it is different from all their other albums. I recommend "Welcome" to any INXS fan and any other fan of great music

This is a great CD!  Each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end.  This makes it nice to just play the entire CD or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another.  So far the Car and Washing machine tracks seem to be our baby's favorites.  When she outgrows the need for this white noise CD, we'll transition her to lullaby or classical music.  For now though, this CD helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times.  As a bonus, the Waves and Rain on the Roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep

Greatest Debut Ever?  *****
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
As a band, The Byrds are one of the greatest and certainly one of the most influential bands in rock and roll history.  Adding to that legacy, "Mr. Tamborine Man's" status as one of the greatest debut albums in rock history is almost without question.  This band could do it all; country, folk, rock, jam, psychedelica, etc, etc.  And this debut was perhaps the pinnacle of their achievements.  Though they would venture into much more adventurous territory ("Notorious Byrd Brothers"), this was where the band was the most solid, the most tight collectively.

Not Like the First One - But Still Very Cool

While Volume 1 of the DREAM BABES series is more accessible with its very girly girl group pop, sun-shiney vocals - Volume 2 offers a little bit of everything - from pop r&b, girl group vocals, pop, swinging pop & even some very early school grrl rock 'n roll - they might be a little more lyrically serious (hence the subtitle REFLECTIONS) but if anything, that's a good thing. It's nice to hear that women were trying different styles and genres and not just singing about about boys ...

As always, opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these Bach cello suites.  Starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this CD that this edition, the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not "technically perfect", but in many ways, his most mature interpretation. You can spend hundreds trying to find a Mercury copy of "the perfect" rendition; or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist, at the height of his humanistic understanding of music, and of life.

Coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences, Blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories:Soulful Blues, Drinking Blues and Guitar Blues. "B.B King - Live At The Regal" is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three.

Nobody captures the spirit and essence of a city at night like New York City's own Ultrablue. The group is the brainchild of keyboardist/producer John Smatla and jazz guitarist Dave Stryker, who bring in an NYC all-star cast of players in addition to their impressive band ensemble to create a sophisticated and evocative musical mood. ULTRABLUE is the latest outing for Ultrablue, and the first release on 215 Records. The project drips of chill, smooth jazz, and rich, rhythmic textures that will keep the project in replay mode for a good while in your car and home players and on your iPod. Special guests include singer/saxophonist Pete Belasco, trumpet/flugelhorn player Randy Brecker, female vocal group, Allure, flutist Nestor Torres and Brazilian vocalist Gabriella Anders. From the sexy saunter, "Guilty Pleasures" and the spicy and sultry, "Indiscretions," to the scintillating "Soul Candy," ULTRABLUE provides such a cool groove and flow that it really does lend itself to be the perfect soundtrack to a night out or in (for that matter). Pete Belasco is featured on the sensual cover "The Summer Knows" while Nestor Torres livens things up on the groove, "Jungle Fever," and the delicious Gabriela Anders delivers an alluring vocal on "Destiny." The project's first single, "Shiver," is already attracting radio airplay from coast to coast... We expect big things from Ultrablue on this and all of their future releases. This is the new standard of Smooth Jazz. ~SANDY SHOR

Best album by Alice Cooper
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Studio album released in 1971, by the original band-a real band with Alice Cooper, Neal Smith, Dennis Dunaway, Michael Bruce, and Glen Buxton. I think the other band members (apart from Cooper), got the short end of the stick. This album, along with these 'Love it to death', 'Billion dollar babies', and 'Love it to death' are so vastly superior to 'his' other albums. The band plays and writes really well together as a 'real' band. Case in point, listen to 'Dada' from a few years later-dreadful! Just wish he had kept a proper band together, even if he fealt that they were not as musically good as some of the late session musicians. Rock is about feel, more than technique in my opinion. I can't even listen to 'Dada' or

I'm not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about (sounds like someone with an axe to grind)but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship. The music is inspired, the melodies transcending, and the emotion - deep and meaningful. As far as "copying Yanni" goes, well - I don't agree, in fact, Yanni is far more generic and less inspired. The sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact NOT the same nor, are they Yanni's creation. I write this review to commend mr farish on his work, and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and couldn't resist his own urge to see his "critique" in print. Ryans music is distinctly his own, no question - and any similarities are tonal, and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of. As far as I'm concerned, you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve's and websites for music to criticize - and well, make themselves feel a little better. Personally, I would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy. All the other stuff is for hacks! enjoy this music! I do.

An outstanding compilation of a wide variety of popular and regional styles from across Mexico.  This set examines both traditional and contemporary music, including a brilliant ska-banda mix by the popular &quot;rock en espanol&quot; band, Cafe Tacuba.  Rancheras, corridos, boleros, indie rock and various stylistic fusions are represented, and even a few sones from Veracruz -- one of my favorite musical genres!  If you are curious about the rich musical heritage of this large but often slighted nation, then check this collection out... It might open more than a few new musical doors

Now I know what you're thinking, why are there two releases of "XX"?  Well after they switched from Eclipse to Universal records they re-released the album "XX" but they also re-recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals (BIG MISTAKE!)  The original album is by far much better than the Universal release in December of 2001.  If you're not sure which one to go with GO WITH THIS ONE!

Gong - 'Live Etc.' (Caroline)  4 1/2 stars
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
'Live Etc' is an absolute must-have compilation for all true Gong fans.It features a total of fifteen live tracks of tunes that originally appeared on the band's key albums 'Camembert Electrique','Flying Teapot','Angel's Egg' and 'You'.Taken from unreleased live soundboard tapes(I assume)from shows between 1973-75.Absolute best cut here is "Where Have All The Flowers Gone?" along with "6/8 Tune",that are the disc's only unreleased material.Other cosmic gems include "Dynamite/I Am Your Animal","Isle Of Everywhere","Oily Way" and "Master Builder".Duration is 78:33.Heard they wanted to add the 16th cut that was originally on the 2-lp record,but the CD simply wouldn't hold it.Talk about wanting to give your fans their money's worth.Long live the mother Gong ship!Recommended

At this stage though, it is only the very wealthy that can afford it.

This is the first cd I've bought in the Liquid Mind series, but after hearing this one, I'll buy more.  The music is calming and soothing; great to fall asleep by which I often do.

Superior to the first Steppenwolf album in many ways, and including a song that tops even 'Born To Be Wild' itself, 'Magic Carpet Ride', is as essential as the group's first album, even to the casual rock fan.

For all lovers of true Flamenco

<text>

With all the 'Neuvo Flamenco' and its accompaning popularity. It is nice (and a relief) I might add, to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form. Not only does this cd contain Sabicas and Nino Ricardo. It also contains four very rare perfomances by Manolo de Huelva. Which are difficult to find anywhere. Also included are Melchor de Marchena performing six pieces. This is truly Pure Flamenco at its best

Pavarotti is incomparable
</Text>
</title>

I was first touched by Pavarotti's voice as a teenager in the early 80's when I saw a PBS special of this concert on television.  The power of his voice and his personality are incomparable.  His rendition of Ave Maria is especially touching.  I would recommend this as a first buy for anyone who is new to the operatic experience, as I was so many years ago

I discovered Seal the same way that most people did: through his utterly beautiful song "Kiss From A Rose".  I heard it on the radio one day, and played it constantly for months after that until I finally decided to purchase the album the song was from.  As it happens, the song is from Seal's most revered album, his multi-platinum 1994 self-titled album.  (This is not to be confused with his other self-titled album, his debut, released in 1991.)  I didn't know what to expect when I bought the album, having heard only one song from it, but months after purchasing it I'm glad I made the gamble.

Refreshing Experience
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
They may have a new name, but their sound remains the same as before. Mixed with club-friendly beats and laid back drunken-style, the Liks have crafted the perfect party CD. Tracks like &quot;Run Wild&quot; (possibly the best track on the CD, certainly the most fun to listen to), &quot;Sickness&quot; (with Butch Cassidy providing some very tight vocals on he hook), and the Neptunes-produced &quot;Best U Can&quot; showcase The Liks' party appeal, while head-nodders like &quot;Bully Foot&quot; (with Busta Rhymes) and &quot;Another Round&quot; create a more relaxed vibe for the listener. The Liks also get outside help from artists like fellow Likwit-Crewmember Defari (&quot;My Dear&quot;) and Kurupt (the cleverly-titled &quot;Promote Violins&quot;). Of course, Xzibit holds it down on his two tracks, &quot;Bar Code&quot; and &quot;151&quot;. The only way this Cd differs from their last releases is the instruments, varying from violins (&quot;Promote Violins&quot;), trumpets (&quot;L-I-K-S&quot;), and even 40 ounce bottles (&quot;40 oz. Quartet&quot; skits). The thing you shouldn't expect to find is deep lyrics or dark productions (go grab Mobb Deep). However, copping &quot;X.O. Experience&quot; could be the best refreshment for this summer's heat. If you like &quot;X.O. Experience&quot;, check out: &quot;Xzibit - Restless&quot;, &quot;Alkaholiks - Likwidation&quot;, &quot;Kurupt - Space Boogie&quot;, &quot;Eastsidaz - Ducez &amp; Trayz&quot

Stunning new take on Gypsy Jazz
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Bireli is not only one of the best living guitar players in gypsy jazz - he is also one of the most creative.  On this album, he gives us a new take on Django's music that is simply stunning.  "Move" has a smaller, more focused sound that it's predecessors, and the addition of the saxophone brings a really fresh twist to this great old music.

Better Than Great
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
What's more to say about what may be the best "rock" album ever (especially if you consider the "My Kingdom" EP to be the second disc in a two disc set)?  The most emotionally wide-ranging album from one of the best bands ever.  Who else has ever made music like FSOL?  The Beatles and Fripp&Crimson are the only possible contenders.  I've never heard anything that does a better job of juxtaposing the terrifying and the unbearably beautiful.  If I could pinpoint the one disinguishing feature of all FSOL/AA releases, it would be (as a line in "The Isness" goes) "...[a longing for] inexhaustible ecstasy." It's all the more poignant on this album because of its being interwoven with themes of terror, paranoia and a sense of unrecoverable loss of something without which life isn't worth living.  It sounds hokey, but just opening up the booklet while listening to "Her Face Forms in Summertime" and reading the scrawled message "things are getting f*&ked up round here" makes my eyes a little watery.  My CD developed a 2 second glitch and I just ordered another one--this is so incredible that nothing less than perfection will do.

This album grabbed my attention from the first measure. Thick and heavy,  this is not like any blues album I've ever heard. Very atypical for Hidalgo  as well. This one is probably an acquired taste- one for the truly hard  core blues fan. The sheer uniqueness grabbed me from the start, and the  more I listen to it, the more I like it. I can only hope there's a Houndog  2 in the works..

I heard The Chairman Dances and went right to Amazon to order this. This ia a lovely little gem of a CD, and it is so pleasing to find John Adams, another great modern American composer. I'm also a fan of composers such as Christopher Rouse, for example, and Joe Leniado Chira is my cousin. Modern composers are a precious resource that we should explore, demand more of and nurture. We afficianados would like to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to the modern genre. Meanwhile, John Adams has impressed me with this disc. The Chairman Dances is my favorite. I can just see Chairman Mao doing a vigorous foxtrot to this, and Tricky Dick feeling jealous. This might be the music that opened China to the West

Jaci comes through again!
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
I have been a fan for Jaci Velasquez for the past eight years and enjoy hearing her voice in both languages.  I do not speak Spanish but enjoy her artistic abilities none the less.  This album lived up to the Velasquez name in my book- My family and I only really enjoy the traditional sounding Christmas carols and tend to not enjoy the revised versions.  Jaci's album not only made sure the carols were sung traditionally but she has given us a gift a couple new songs that will be added to my Christmas traditions!  Overall I LOVE this album and the only reason I did not give it a full five stars was that I am done with that Chipmunk Song.  Sorry everybody.

For those who have watched the movie Jaws (ask yourself, who hasn't) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score John Williams did for it.

4th Complete group SCC album is decent

Their 4th album as a complete group (not counting the few album Havoc & Prode'je put out) is my least favorite of the 4 SCC albums I have (I don't have the one from 1992 or 2005), but it still gets itself a 4 star rating.  Out of the 13 songs on here none are vclassics or worth skipping; 4 are ok and the other 9 are good.  Like all their albums, guests are minimal and are on are on 2 of the 13 songs.  Production is mostly handled by Prode'je (as with all their albums) he does get a little help from Robert "Fonksta" Bacon & Tomie Mundie.  A good album to have for SCC fans but not their best work.

This CD provides a fantastic overview of Rypdal, who has been recording for ECM for 30+ years now.  The tracks range from pieces with an &quot;electric Miles&quot; sound to an orchestrated track.  While very diverse, the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique,atmospheric tone and excellent compositions.  The infamous ECM sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering.  Informative liner notes as well.  Highly recommended

Lives in the balance?
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
What has happened to the song "Lives in the balance" on this set?  If you go to his website it sounds really great!!!  On this set it sounds awfull!!  It sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with.  The packaging if you could call it that is really lame.  Foam dots for holders?  What do you do when those fall off?  I suppose you put the cd's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up.  Not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work!  True you do get alot of songs for the money but, there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it.  If you own an I-pod I suggest you go to apples I-tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less

It was my full belief that the next time we would hear from Buju Banton on an album would be on the now 2 years anticipated `Rasta Got Soul' album. The album which has still yet to arrive (and may never) was said to be along Buju's best and might actually rival his seminal classic `Til Shiloh. He even tipped his hand 2 years ago by releasing the album's first single, the `magical' Magic City. So the world was waiting to see just how much Soul the album had.

I ordered mine from here (Amazon Marketplace) a couple weeks ago, and I'm a very happy camper. This is one of the best online purchases I've made in a long, long time! First of all, there are songs I've never heard before, so by owning this compilation, it helps me get to know the band's material, or Siobhan's own solo stuff much better. All the songs are very well-written and catchy. Thanks to my best friend, he drew me toward's SS's music back in the 90's with the "HORMONALLY YOURS" CD. SS's music was always something I pushed to the "back burner" because I didn't know what to make of it. But in the past 2 years, I've focused on the new material from the "Shakespears Sister #3" album...and it blew me away! Siobhan is a true musical genius!

The previous review has a few inaccuracies I thought I'd correct. First off, the beats on all of Atmosphere's albums, including this one, are produced and created by Ant, not DJ Abilities. Ant does not perform live, and so Slug often used to perform with DJ Abilities (and others). This may change in the next album as Atmosphere now includes a band soon to tour, but it's extermely likely Ant will be included in the production.

Although this sports new remastering, unless you have either the Golden Hits CD available here at Amazon and your local CD shop, the now out of print Golden Celebration boxed set or the 2 volume "Patti Page Collection" series (Volume 2 is also out of print), this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on Golden Hits except for Let Me Go Lover instead of With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order.  Fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with Let Me Go Lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff, either buy Golden Hits, the boxed set and the 2 volume Patti Page Collection series, and BTW, Vol. 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at Amazon

As a pretty big comedy fan thanks to XM radio, i have listened to a lot of comics and I own a lot of comic CD's (Mitch Hedberg, Bill Hicks, Emo Philips, Lewis Black, Steven Wright, Pablo Francisco etc.) and my absolute favorite is Unprotected.  There is not a slow part on this CD and it never fails to bring everyone to tears on a long car ride.  His quick and merciless wit is better than any other comic in the US.  His family must be very understanding since he doesn't hesitate to include every detail of their personal lives in his act, but it all serves to create a punchline that we can all relate to.  The highlights of this CD are his daughter's boyfriend and guidelines for resuming sex after a heart attack.  I highly highly reccomend this

The poetry which originated each selection is included and provides a meditation in itself.  Highly recommended

The recording is of very high quality, and I agree with another review, vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even better.  The banter between the artists in between the  musical numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these  shows live.  One other observation, if you buy this not having a HUGE  appreciation for Sammy already, you will be blown away by his talent.  ..thanks to  Sinatra family for releasing this disc.  Hopefully many more are  forthcoming

I was very young to really appreciate the in-s and outs of this band and the members between SAMMY, Roth and EVH!  I honestly can consider myself a newbie to this time-tested rockers.  I just downloaded this off of iTunes and i can tell u folks, every track is amazing! its like when Lars (Metallica) said once: "i was always amazed with G&R"...if i may borrow this line, i had always heard of the great EVH vs. Hagar vs Roth but honestly never appreciated this Guitar work before today! EVH is an amazing talent and it will continue to influence i am sure allot of new artists. My brother in Law was debating with us about Slash, Sammy, EVH, and Edge (U2), Clapton  and apparently they all chose EVH.  I didn't believe it till i heard it!  EVH is an inspiration. Anyone interested even remotely in any of these guys in EVH's history, should get this album because it is truly harnesses from almost all the worlds EVH has been to and in!

This is part 2 of a set titled SAY IT RIGHT. The CD has a blue and white style vs. the part 1 that has a yellow and white style on disc and cover. Also in a slim-line jewel case with the title track, non-album track, but an added dance remix plus video. If you enjoyed the first 2-track CD then this is a must. Dance lovers will definitely find this to be a totally spectacular production.

Almost a classic in my book.  We bumped this on the southside of Chicago when this dropped. These two were like a west coast EPMD because they blended perfectly. U could tell them apart easily because Gangsta D had the eazy-e voice with the hard lyrics. While KK had a gruff voice and was a str8 clown. KK would say anything.

This record is a fine example of earnest juju music.  Other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards.  Chief Commander Obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife.  Keep in mind, this means amazing percussion work, intertwining guitar lines, loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals.  If you're interested, you should buy it.  It will make you happy, no matter how you were feeling, and what you're doing

This EP is so good, that words cannot do it justice. They thought so too and exercised restraint (no lyrics) on this album. It is a departure from the previous album From the Vapor of Gasoline (which is also a very good album) in other ways, too, however; it features a more delicate production and more intricate interplay between the instruments. The production is such that it highlights the timbre of each instrument and, thus, their interdependency, whereas the previous album seemed content to let everything settle into a murky consistency at various points (usually when things started to rock). FTVOG also had the problem of being a bit monotonous (of course: in the end, you grew to enjoy it for all its shortcomings). All the Suits Began to Fall OFf seems to be flawless, however - a well-rounded tour; very beautiful, bold and particular. Try if you like: John Fahey, Tortoise, June of 44, Sea Tiger, etc

Grisman and Friends Kick It Up a Notch!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Some musicians, like fine chefs, make it look so easy.  David Grisman is one of them.  On the CD, &quot;I'm Beginning to See the Light,&quot; the prolific mandolinist extraordinaire is joined by Scottish guitar virtuoso  Martin Taylor and veteran Grisman Quintet members Jim Kerwin and George  Marsh (on bass and drums/percussion, respectively) for one hot little  album.  While the song list is comprised of many well-loved standards, such  as &quot;Autumn Leaves,&quot; &quot;Makin' Whoopee,&quot; &quot;Lover  Man,&quot; and &quot;Cheek to Cheek,&quot; the Taylor/Grisman Quartet seems  to have so much fun preparing its stew and adds enough incredible  seasonings to the pot to make Emeril shout, &quot;Bam!&quot;  As Don  Stierberg, who penned the liner notes, says:  &quot;Music need not be  trendy to be great.&quot;  I wholeheartedly agree.

Dub Inna Deep Deep Space
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Modern dub stylings from an assortment of recording artists, ranging from the bizarre and brilliant (check The Lost Scrolls of Hamarik's darkly deranged How To Find Royal Jelly), to the utterly unforgiveable (namely, Luciano's appaling attempt at Police &amp; Thieves). Luckily for us, most of the tunes here fall into or around the former category, with great contributions from St. Germain (bouncing dub-disco on A Dub Experience), Grant Phabao (updated roots righteousness on Andub Head Yudu) and Boozoo Bajou (with the wonderfully cheesey Divers). And let's not overlook Cottonbelly's 90's classic Tempest Dub, which resurrects an old Scientist tune to spine-tingling effect. Only the fairly plain Seven Dub and the aforementioned Luciano really fail to ignite...All in all then, a worthwhile collection which works very nicely as a whole - providing you program the CD player to skip the occassional duffer

Incredible follow up to Rated R which I didn't think could be equaled and they did.  Flat out incredible songwriting, amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best.  If you grew up in the 70's as I did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you. "Go With The Flow" is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you won't be skipping any songs on this disc. Baby Boomers rejoice, rock is back

The Best R&P Gospel I've ever heard!!

<Text>
I have been following gospel since the early 80s.  I am a big fan of contemporary gospel and Shei Atkins defines how R&P gospel should sound.  Trinitee 5:7 along with Dawkins & Dawkins have done a great job so far, but Shei Atkins covers it all--Relationships (cheating, divorce, pre-marital sex); worship; hymns; enocuragement; you name it and she has a song for it.  I just bought the CD and I can't take it out of my CD player!!

One Of The Best Albums Of The Year
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Both the Italian version (Io Canto) and the Spanish version (Yo Canto) are excellent, and amongst the best albums that I have heard this past year. The music is absolutely beautiful, fresh, and very well paced, and Laura's voice is soaring! The quality of this album is exceptional....the production of the songs lends to Laura's very passionate approach to them. Without understanding a word of either version, I cannot get enough of them! Listening to Laura on this latest release of hers over and over again, each song continues to grow on me and I find myself completely absorbed in this album! Do yourself a favor and get this one....especially if you live in the United States. It will give you an opportunity to experience the power of what music can be if done right. You'll find yourself relating to words you don't even understand!

Sharing Italian Music with the World
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
In this CD Laura Pausini performs songs from a variety of Italian singer-songwriters.  She ads her personal touch to all of them, of course.  The results are lovely and inspired.  A lot of the songs already had versions in castellano, but Laura and her team have written new Spanish lyrics to some of them.  All of these songs were made famous by their creators.  Most of the songs are ballads, but there are some midtempo tracks in the title track, "Dos" (Due, by Raf) and "Estrella gemela" (by Eros Ramazzotti), and danceable pop in "Mi banda toca rock."  I don't know about the comment from the reviewers below about "Mi banda toca rock" as Menudo song (a horrible thought to some of us!), but the original Italian version was fun.  It's not a bubblegum song, but about the combination of traditional Latin music (Latin in the original sense, all the musical varieties of romance-language speakers) and rock music, something that was starting to happen when the song was written.  This reminds me that someone was commenting that one of the songs had some sections in English.  I believe they are wrong about the song.  "Estrella gemela" has some sections in English, but that is the way it was originally written and performed by Eros Ramazzotti (in Italian and Spanish), to emphasize the influence of African-American gospel music in the song.  Laura also references this influence by using gospel chords at the start of the song.  All in all, this is a great album, so give it a shot.  Whether you speak the language or not, the Italian version of the album is even better.  Laura just keeps getting better with time!  Laura sei bravissima

Nothing deep, by any means, but simply a light, airy listen, with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes. Even though the songs (most of them) weren't in the movie, they remind me of it, of the whole Hawaiian atmosphere. My favorite tracks, excluding the ones included on the previous CD, are Blue Hawai'i (by Elvis), My Little Grass Shack, Coconut (it's just bizarre, but addicting, making you smile with absurdity), Island in the Sun, Pineapple Princess, and Love Me Tender. Again, it's nothing dramatic or swirling, but it you adored Lilo &amp; Stitch (And how can you not?) and all it stood for, this CD might just bring some warmth into a cold day. Don't think about it. Listen and pretend you're there

I borrowed this CD from a public library, having liked the track "Crazy Life" on the Empire Records Soundtrack, and I was immediately blown away by how consistently good Coil is the whole way through. It is their most mature album, full of gentle emotion and idealism, and puts the listener in a good mood. Glen Phillip's voice is unique, confident, and beautiful. I fell in love immediately with "Rings" and "Dam Would Break". The haunting and beautiful harmonies captivate. "Little Buddha" is so different but so good as well.

I love it so.  I bought it after seeing the video for "Make You Feel That Way" and I haven't been disappointed.  Love the vibe of the CD...it just flows and the mix is well done, as you go from a "head-nodder" to a smooth groove so seamlessly.  I just put it in and let it play!  My absolute favorite jam is "Nowhere Fast," which comments on what we were, what we are and what we hope to be "tomorrow."  I love this CD so much, I went and bought their other two full play CD's.  I make my girls sick with how much I play this CD.  I guess I'll eventually take it out the rotation, maybe "tomorrow!"  A must for anyone who loves great HIP HOP

The thing about him is that his playing has always sounded mature and developed, like he was born to play.  On this CD, Felicidade in particuliar, he simmers, builds to a rolling  boil, and simmers again so nicely as he takes you to Brasil. Also the  straight ahead playing on Triste' is nothing short of marvelous playing by  the group!  The whole is CD is great. Go 'head Joe

This album is the shyit, cougnut and c-fresh deliver, the only problem you might have with this album is figuring out which one is cougnut and which one is c-fresh, but as you listen you will tell differences. &quot;Back in the days&quot; is real old album, so audio can be bad for a couple of the tracks but there isnt a weak track on this album. The beats don't get too bass heavy untill &quot;Hillary&quot; after that song the next 4 tracks or so are very bass heavy, but the flows are tops. These guys are the definition of gangsta, and is a must for anybody who likes gangsta rap. All guests are sick to, Dre Dog,Cellski,Chewy,R.b.l,2.2 and Mack and Al Kapone. Definetly a classic

I got the pleasure of seeing Albert open for bb king. Unfortunately for BB king, because once Albert started playing his Flying V, with blues power, he demoralized anybody that came after him. He had the entire Universal amphitheater standing. and stayed standing for most of his show. blues power is one of his best. Get, listen, and then really listen. Because you can feel your skin crawl with extacy from those notes..

The Bloodshot Gang knows how to have a good time!  If you're into the whole Alt.Country thing, you know that some of it is very sincere and serious (ie, Uncle Tupelo, Jayhawks).  Now I love "No  Depression," and "Blue Earth," but this is an altogether  different quadrant of alternative country known as Militant Honky Tonk, or  just Insurgent Country.  Truth be told, this incredible anniversary  compilation does have some poignant, serious numbers (Rico Bell's  "Money to Burn," the Texas Rubies' "Blue Diamond Mine,"  Mike Ireland's "I'd Like To"), but for the most part these  maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously.  You've got  Andre Williams and Sally Timms singing "I'll stick to you like  glue...", in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going  "G-L-E-U, GLUE!"  You've got a song with a man and a woman  serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss  each other's bodies.  You've got Kim Docter and Moonshine Willy belting out  "Turn the Lights Down Low," which really ought to be a hit it's  so catchy.  And you've got some great deadpan covers -- the Waco Brothers  do a country rave-up of the Who's Baba O'Riley," Red Star Belgrade  does it to AC/DC's "Highway to Hell," and best of all, the Unholy  Trio turns Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise" into an understated  redneck anthem.  I'm only scratching the surface here, with 40 tracks over  2 discs.  This is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that  sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on...

Any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission.  These pieces, each melodically rich and honed like a fine gem, remind me more of classical romanticism than what normally passes for &quot;New Age&quot;.  Sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of wine and let this beautifully-crafted music weave its web...it's &quot;feel good&quot; music that also has an intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor

Where Did It All Go Wrong?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I consider this the first album in the second half of the career of Oasis. Following the departure of Bonehead and Guigsy, this album is basically all the Gallagher brothers. Having learnt lessons from Be Here Now, Oasis have gone back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over the top production from Be Here Now. While the songs are not as good on here, they sound better and the whole album sounds as if it wasn't as rushed. This signifies a big change of direction for the band, with little less ego's and a more sober approach to their music, it is only the songwriting that lets this album down. My least favourite of all Oasis albums, it features two really good songs, 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones. It is missing another two songs to make it complete, I think it should have included the B'sides 'lets all make believe' and 'carry us all'. It still includes a few Beatle-esque songs 'who feels love' and 'roll it over' and Noel once again takes over lead vocal duties, this time on two tracks, 'where did it all go wrong' and 'sunday morning call'.

What I love most about Scofield's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style. He is careful not to over do it, while still demonstrating skill and precision. His riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed.  The only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding  songs, I rarely make it to the end of this CD. Still for those who enjoyed  &quot;A Go-Go&quot;, this one is quite similar, so make sure to pick it up.  This quality funk CD with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking, but  is a great casual listen. (Guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas  here!

A ridiculously good album. This is as good an introduction to Jawbox as you're going to find. It's got most of their really great songs, plus some live songs which are great. Another good thing is that Desoto Records (the label that was started by the band) has re-released the CD, so it shouldn't be as hard to find

I gotta be honest, when I first listened to this album I was dissapointed. But like any truly amazing album, it just took some decoding, listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing. Essentially, GaT are four people who are amazing at what they do, and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly. Their first album, emphasizer, blew me away, but I felt it lost steam around halfway through. This album does no such thing, and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album, which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for. This gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department. But dont get me wrong, this cd SOUNDS amazing. Anyway, I saw them live last night in NYC, and they blew my mind... I recommend this CD to ANYONE, and see them live if you get the RARE opportunity!

Two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith. There are so many good tracks on this set that it's hard to pick out some over the others. A couple of superb standouts are Jolson's "Swanee" and "Rock-A-Bye," although every track is just excellent. The sound quality on the set is outstandingly great. I hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by Jolson and Crosby

This is the best "cover" album I have ever seen or heard in my life.  A wonderful selection of material and a reflection of Agnetha's great judgment of how best to pay tribute to her favorite, and most influential, musical artists. Her voice is absolutely flawless and just as powerful (and pure) as her days of old with ABBA.  It would have sold well with the right kind of promotion such as touring which I read she had planned at one point. Unfortunately, she had to cancel any such ideas.  I would travel anywhere in the world to see her live just once in my life, whether it be to listen to any of the catchy tunes from this album or anything previous.  We can only hope the day will come that she will do a live show again for us adoring and anxious fans.  It's certainly not out of the realm of possibility.  It is neither an impossibility that Agnetha record subsequent material in the not too distant future as this album without a doubt indicates she has so much great music left in her soul to share with the world

I don't see how they can compare these guys to The Mars Volta or Coheed and Cambria. I can hear the prog elements but it's more of a Rush kind of prog rock,shorter 3 minute songs compared to 12 minute epics. They are missing the one thing that would make them a true prog rock band: the songs just aren't as epic as a TMV or a C&amp;C song. I think reviewers liken Brazil to these other bands because their singer has a high pitched singing voice. This is still an amazing album that is well worth your time. Go into it expecting Sparta rather than The Mars Volta and you won't be disappointed

When this album first came out, I felt jilted. But I recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and I think its a great album. Make no mistake, if you're a die-hard 80's rocker, you'll hate this album. The production is raw, and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed. But that doesn't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record. If you can keep an open mind, I think this ablum is one that you'll love

whoa... this CD rocks, one of my favorite anti-flag albums for sure. This CD may not be what some of the harder punk fans want from anti-flag but i think it also shows they're growth as a band. They can play more than just really loud hard punk (though they play that awesome too!!). Some of the songs on this album incredibly powerful, and some are really catchy too. War Sucks Lets Party is a great anarchist anthem, and One Trillion Dollars is amazingly moving (i mean, seriously! 1 Trillion $ spent on weapons around the world in 2004!) Every track is good and has its own message! They seem to have no problem coming up w/ new songs... there are so many things to ridicule in our gov. I just wish that more people would listen to this band's message.

Well, this isn't At the Gates.  Nightrage reminds me of many old Arch Enemy guitar tunes that were so melodic.  Of course, that leads into Gus G. substituting Chris on concerts being an excellent choice, as they make very similar melodies.  Some people say this album is heavy, which it is in some parts.  But its melodic death, there are no signs of thrash or anything.  Just great melodies, great headbanging music.  Add this to your collection, I think its better than Sweet Vengeance

Chris Joss delivers some serious blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the times of bell bottoms, afros and platform shoes!  Joss' "You've Been Spiked" is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the funkiest music ever!  In fact, this music sounds so authentic you would think they came straight out of the 70's...but it's all circa the 21st century.  It's good to know that there are still modern cats (especially on the ESL Record label)who know how to recapture music from days gone by.

This is a really great follow up to Allison Moorer's debut album ALABAMA SONG. THE HARDEST PART, her sophomore CD, was released two years after her debut in September 2000. It builds on the sound presented on her first, and the songs are nothing short of great. My favorite track, though not her own, is her emotional reading of the Rolling Stones' &quot;Bring Me All Your Lovin&quot;. She makes this song into her own. &quot;No Next Time&quot; is another favorite, the lyrics are excellent, a great breakup song. The title track is a nice midtempo country number. &quot;Send Down An Angel&quot; is very sad but touching at the same time. Other highlights include &quot;It's Time That I Tried&quot;, &quot;Day You Said Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Is It Worth It&quot; and &quot;Feeling That Feeling Again&quot;. Overall, to me this is her best album. You can't go wrong with any of them but this is an artistic acheivement, and one of her best albums yet

I have been a fan since Valotte. and I like the other reviewers here, can't believe why this cd didn't receive the airplay it deserves!There must have been some politics in there, with Sean's cd coming out on the same day ( Yoko?) It is one of those cds that you just leave on and you don't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you don't like! I love every song!! Especially "Day after Day"," I should have known", "I don't want to know" and my fav right now "Cold".. I hope that what I have heard is true that he is working on his latest now. Can't wait! Buy this cd.. you won't regret it

Wanting Farmer John Cale
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
No use thumbing the pages of Cale's elegant scrapbook of an autobiography, 'What's Welsh For Zen?, to glean hard data on this one melodic gem. Coming after the heady, if problematic days of the Velvets, there's barely an acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format. The abrasive thrashing rock of 'McBeth'(while indicating his imminent direction) serves the one discordant note. Throughout,Cale namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a distant past. Language had been severed from lineal meaning, in rock, since Bob went electric. Pete Brown writing for Jack Bruce's towering masterpieces, 'Songs For a Sailor', & 'Harmony Row'; Keith Reid with Procul Harum, were mixing up the lyric medicine, presumably with other pharmacuticals & making sumptuous music on a par with 'Paris 1919'. That date? The birth of Surrealism,(and similar writing to Cale's efforts herein) perhaps? The Russian Revolution? Cale's singing on 1919 had a world weary distance to it, which suited the reflective jabberwocky of the songs; stretched out vowells on,'planing lakes', 'elephants that sing','looking out from here at half past France.' It was far from banal music, however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings, viola & piano Cale painted. These lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung. 'Locusts' was something of a revisiting to this pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness. 'Fragments of a Rainy Season' is a good retrospective concert. And some of the fuge written around the hommage to Andy Warhol is very moving stuff. Go John

This is a fabulous CD and exactly what I was looking for.  I'm also thrilled that it has an accompanying book with all the sheet music.  I am leading a seder this year for a church group who has never heard any of the  songs before, so I wanted the traditional melodies, easy to follow sheet  music, and easy guitar chords.  This is perfect!  I'm so pleased

Be Here Now

<Text>
This is a difficult album to review. People either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced, overblown waste of their time. However, I can say that this is my favorite Oasis album. Why? That's a very good question...maybe because Be Here Now was my introduction to Oasis, and I could tell that this band had a lot to offer, even through the drug-addled, overproduced songs that seemed to last forever. Each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it, two characteristics of most Oasis songs.

I have been listening to this album for at least 12 years and it rarely leaves my CD changer.  I played the cassette version until it literally would not play any more, and it was one of the first CDs I bought.  A relative first introduced me to this album and of course &quot;Coming Up Close&quot; was the reason I bought my own copy. But I came to love each song and appreciate Aimee Mann as an exceptionally gifted songwriter.   It is a great &quot;Road Trip&quot; album and &quot;On Sunday&quot; makes the perfect &quot;Summer Song&quot;.  The mix is not mainstream pop/rock.  It is not a 1980's anthem, but it is one of the defining moments, for me.  The lyrics have meaning, which sometimes defies what the '80's were about.  The only other thing I can say is Listen to this CD!  I am sure you will find Mann's unique voice as captivating as I do. It is a definite must have for one's CD library

Did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the FM station sound about the same?  Maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars?  The Libertines are - or at least were - one of those diamonds in the rough.

This is by far the best psychopathic album ever released. Riddlebox is now in second place. Madrox schools ever other artist on psychopathic with this album. Beats are bangin' and lyrics are flawless! Great flows and he mixes funny with wicked. Best songs are This B*tch and Hey Phatty. Great album by the best rapper of our time. Madrox is so under rated. I wish for his sake he would blow up huge but not lose his soul in the process. Buy this album, best rap album ever made

A good look at a speeding Trane...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Considered one of Coltrane's 'searching' periods, this CD has a lot to offer in the way of understanding Trane's restless nature. Never one to stand on laurels, Coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out. This one is mostly ballad and blues based, with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the Trane spectrum. Track #2, "I Love You" finds him playing furious, cerebral runs on the instrument, and , frankly, not as 'listenable' as one may like; whereas the track with Donald Byrd is as 'in the pocket' as you'll ever hear. All in all, a very realistic look at a genius in motion

Often Overlooked Live Trane
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I consider this to be one of the finest live Coltrane recordings out there.  It was also one of the first Coltrane albums I picked up, and it was a fantastic gateway to some of his more abstract live recordings on followup releases like LIVE AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD AGAIN and LIVE IN JAPAN.  This is much more similar to AFRO BLUE IMPRESSIONS which is another overlooked release.  By this point in time, Trane had already done some work with Eric Dolphy and his playing was growing in a much more abstract direction as we would hear on A LOVE SUPREME just one year later.

The best of the late 60's
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is a compilation, but the original Incense and Peppermints album was really revolutinary for the time. I will date myself now, but I remember hearing this song on the radio in our car and was mesmerized by it. It was the first Lp I had ever bought. I actually wore out the groves on the Lp and came across another a few years ago. To this day, almost 40 years after I first heard the Strawberry Alarm Clock, I still like Incense and Peppermints as well as their other songs. Their style ranges from acid rock to jazz. The musicians are all very talented and the band works as a team as opposed to many of the bands of the era. Their recordings are really high quality and certainly not over processed like a lot of today's music is. SAC was in an era where 60's music was in transition from the early Beatles and old time R&R sound to a more acid rock sound. Lyrics like 'tune in, turn on, turn your eyes around.. look at yourself' were typical of SAC's lyrical style as well as the thinking of the times. It was an odd time. On one side, we had Woodstock, mini-skirts, muscle cars and fun fun fun, But, on the dark side, there were civil rights problems and the Viet Nam war. This transitional period was a kind of awakening for the country and for music. Although not as popular as names like the Doors, Jefferson Airplane and Steppenwolf, the Strawberry Alarm Clock still had a huge following. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to see them (or the Doors!) when they came to the city where I lived during the late 60's. This album is a nice compilation of  SAC's hits. The songs are as fresh and original sounding as they were almost 40 years ago.

The first time you play this CD you're just gonna hate it. Promise Ring's third album is the opposite of this. Very Emergency is super catchy and tight but you get sick of it quick, there's just not much there. That understood, this album will rock you for years. It grows on you. At first listen it sounds like really bad emo demos. Like the faceless band you saw open for Fugazi the last time they hobbled into town. No hooks, no choruses, lots of really bad singing and sloppy guitar [with the drums mixed way too loud, an emo thing]. On the 100th listen, if you make it that far, it will sound like an old friend yammerin' on about the good old days. Trust me, it's a desert island disc in the making, I envy those of you just discovering this Cd

2006 Top 3 Albums
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
If this album didn't come out at its destinated time, 2006 would have been one of the worst years for gospel music.  Outside of Kurt Carr's cd, this album makes singing gospel music worthwhile.  Donald Lawrence knows how to send out a group and bring in a new era of singers.  That's basically what this finale does, it brings into the forefront the future of the gospel music scene.  We have new artists emerging in Blanche (McAlister-not sure if she is going to just do the first name like MaDonna, Cher, Mandisa, ummmmm, think about it!!!!!!!!), DeWayne Woods (thanks for the testimony and great Sunday morning rocking song - this is hint to all church musicians sing this song when church is a lil dead and pick it up), The Murrills, LaJeune Thompson (sang girl), and Sheri from the duo of Ted & Sheri.  There are so many hits on the whole cd from God Is, God, You Are An Heir, Giants, Blessing from Abraham, Encourage Yourself, of course all of the older stuff.  One thing missing is Kelly Price should have guested on I Walk With God or bring back Stephanie Mills.

Unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide, and fortified roots reggae album! If you don't have Firehouse Rock in your CD collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan, you may need to re-evaluate what you think you know about Jamaican music. The Roots Radics, especially the rythym section, utilize (with supreme efficacy, I might add) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae "riddims." On top of the Radics, the Wailing Souls add ethereal vocals, while staying masterfully conscious. Firehouse Rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible Jamaican history and an absolute must have

If you enjoyed Explosions In The Sky's last album "The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place", and the songs by the group on the "friday night lights soundtrack", then surely, you shall find love for their newest record "All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone". If you are new to Explosions In The Sky, I can only personally describe their music to you as lush, captivating, graceful, energetic, and highly inspirational art rock instrumentations. Please ignore reviewers who rate this album negatively because they don't like it as much as their last album(yet). "All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone" is different than previous records; It is alot darker, but at the same time hopeful and promising, best listened to on a rainy day or a cold dark night(again, personal description). What more can I say... this is about as beautiful as three guitars and a drum set can sound. My favorite album of 2007 so far.

Dan's Best
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I first heard Dan singing background vocals on the Jackson Browne album "Late for the Sky".  I was 16.  I went out and bought this album (which I STILL have!!) even though I had never heard it.  I had the pleasure of seeing Dan open for the Eagles at the Spectrum in support of this album in Phila, in 1974; I was a junior in high school.  They all joined in on "Best of My Love" and it just blew mw away. He had this really interesting piece of cloth on his piano.  Few people had heard of him prior to this album. This is by far his BEST album.  It is more rock and roll than the rest of his sappy later work in the 80's and a true songwriting gem.  I can remember singing "Morning Sky" in my friend's Ford on the way to school. You have to listen to it over and over.. "Someone's Been Tellin' You Stories" had a sly sexual rhyme in it that was not played on radio at that time. The musicianship on this album only serve to enhance the quality of the songwriting.  This was the most raw of Dan's albums, and by ar, the most superior.  Sadly, Dan is now fighting advanced prostate cancer (check out his website).  Let's hope he will make a full recovery and record and tour again soon.  This is a must have for anyone who is a fan of any 1970's rock and roll.

Essential existential.....

I bought this album when it was first released in the 70's. Heaven and Hell was hot item and passed through my senior school from ear to ear amongst 'those kids in the know' in much the same way that a joint would these days. The movements build on a theme throughout the work and reflect the care that went into creating some classical overtures. Only later in life could I get the similarities to Carl Orf and Khachaturian. This is a real masterpiece and a snapshot in time of when Prog really was prog. Listen to it in full and then catalogue alongside Camel's 'The Snow Goose', the original 'Tubular Bells' by MIke Oldfield, 'Brain Salad Surgery' by ELP and finally ' Snowflakes are dancing' by Tomita.  Please dont compare this work to the keybored pop, I chose my spelling, of the 1980's If you enjoy Vangelis, as I do, you might also want to listen to the compositions of Ennio Morricone, he is the man who wrote that great music that follows Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns.

The music contained Trout Mask Replica is some of the most unique, acid-drenched art to ever be pressed. The songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella tunes and the crazed jams the Captain and his band are known for. Several strange, unconventional themes are visited and revisted throughout the track list, such as bulbs, gingham, trout, and a variety of other surreal, sensously described wildlife. However, if there's any reason to buy Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, it's to listen to the album as a whole. I find it difficult to listen to any other way. While I find this to be true, I do have favorites that I go to when introducing friends to the Captain, or simply jamming out to without dedicating myself to the full experience: "Ella Guru", "Dachaus Blues", "Dust Blows Forward", "Neone Meat Dream", and "Old Fart at Play" stick out

The album that killed FNM's career....
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
....and secured their musical legacy.  The Real Thing was a solid rock/rap mixture with newly hired Mike Patton providing vocals.  On Angel Dust, Patton had a lot more creative input, providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to Faith No More.  It's a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially, has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts - and with good reason.  This album is all over the board.  Land of Sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies (which is the supposed inspiration), while Caffeine is an anthem for Patton's drug of choice, and one of FNM's most energetic recordings.  Then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing Patton's range and sense of fun, like RV, which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an RV.  Not exactly bilboard material, but fun.

great songwriting obliterated by too much &quot;death&quot; growling
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
One reviewer remarked that Morten Veland had &quot;done it again.&quot;  Yup, he shot himself in the foot again, just like he did on Tristania's &quot;Beyond the Veil.&quot;  Veland has an obvious talent in songwriting and building arrangements, and he definitely has a knack for surrounding himself with quality musicians.  His problem is that rather than using his death metal growling for proper effect, where it's appropriate, he just plasters it everywhere, and again lessens what would otherwise have been an incredible CD.  With all of the talent that is present in this band, it would certainly have been better to let them come out of the background a little more.  The songs where Veland does that (which are all too few), like &quot;On the Wane,&quot; are easily the CD's best moments.  To the band's credit, the songs are more varied than on BOTV, with some of the guitar parts sounding like more traditional heavy metal riffs (especially at the beginning of the opening track).  It's definitely still melodic goth-metal, but shows some new directions for Veland, which I find promising.  Now, if he would just cut back on the growling...say to 50% of the CD...Sirenia's next CD will be a sure winner

I usually don't do album reviews but I gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and I was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine I call &quot;The Sauce&quot; So many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings.  Word of mouth is bliss. A-G-2-A-KE who came out on Rap-A-Lot hasn't come out with a cd since this classic.  I'm salty they didn't &quot;make it&quot; because this was heavily slept on

Cecil Taylor's Unique Sound "World"
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
For the past few years it has been very difficult to locate Candid jazz CDs, the label that critic Nat Hentoff created over forty years ago. This was a real shame because some classic recordings, including Booker Little's "Out Front" and Max Roach's "We Insist!: Freedom Now Suite," were on this label. I am happy to report that it was not because all of the albums were being deleted, but because they were (slowly) being remastered. Now some of the seminal early recordings of iconoclastic pianist Cecil Taylor are resurfacing, like "Jumpin' Punkins" and now "The World of Cecil Taylor." It is my opinion that Taylor's currently unavailable (at least domestically) "New York City R&B" and "World of C.T." are two of the great new jazz recordings of the early 60s. "World," recorded over two successive days in October 1960, is basically a trio date, with Buell Neidlinger on bass and Dennis Charles on drums, and Archie Shepp joining on tenor sax for two tracks, "Air" and the standard "Lazy Afternoon." This disc is one of Shepp's first recorded performances and the saxman apparently had trouble with Taylor's music -- I recall the now out of print Mosaic set of this material collecting some 15 plus outtakes of "Air." But the master takes are truly masterful, and I am delighted that with this CD available once again, we can all return to "The World of Cecil Taylor.

I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You, what more can you say about the greates soul album of all time. This album released all of the music in Aretha that was screaming to be released. It displayed a very mature Aretha with complex emotions, very everyday lyrics, ones that make you say, oh yeah girl, lol. but also a delivery that the average person couldn't lay down and dream about pulling off. This is just testiment that, even at such a young age, she was THE QUEEN

The Private Press
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
Dj Shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today. Threading the thin line between commercial and underground, and finding his niche somewhere in between (as UNKLE says, the middle ground between light and shadow) DJ Shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth. I was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release, and actually purchased it before I bought Endtroducing, which is by far DJ Shadow's best album, and one of the best albums ever made. By sampling elements from just about anywhere Shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create mini-movies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value, and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music. I am actually glad I bought this album before Endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is; a work of art, and a continual growing of Shadow's talents. Had I bought Endtroducing before this and writtwn a review I'm sure I would have garnered it with a 4 star review, but that is simply not the case here. While Endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album, Josh Davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album, and given us an album that I'm sure years from now I will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time. Best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home (possibly with a little mary in tow, if you know what I mean), the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows, and the beats are flawless, especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis. See the thing is that Shadow bases his music upon how he feels, and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve. Radiohead for example has a way of doing this, and it is not surprising then that one of DJ Shadows favorite artists is Radiohead, they both fuse these elements into their music, and achieve monumental status in my opinion. The package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation, and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package. If you enjoy this album then I highly recommend any of Shadows works: Endtroducing, Preemptive Strike, The Private Press, and In Tune and On Time, which is a live set recorded in support of this album. UNKLE is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hip-hop, rock and techno, with guest appearences by Mike D of the Beastie Boys, Thom Yorke from Radiohead, and others from throughout the music industry. If you've never heard of DJ Shadow before, then I must say that you are missing out, if you are at all interested in underground music, do yourself a favor and pick up any of Shadow's albums or collaborations, I guarantee you will extremely impressed, as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time. Peace out

This music is undefinable ultimately. Oh yes, one can say parts sound like hard rock or progressive. One can say many things about it. For me, this, along with "Up the Downstairs" are probably their two best and they are both as different as night and day. I've become a collector of PT's stuff and like most of it very much indeed. Check out some of the side projects of the members in the band--like Blackfield and No-Man. They are worth good listenings too. But, you know, this wouldn't be a bad album to start your PT experience with. No, not at all

The second half is a little hard to understand, and it louds like is was recorded poorly, that is why i gave it four stars.  Track 2 is worth the money spent on the cd because that track is 8 mins of pure comedy.  Eddie makes fun of Stevie Wonder and boxer Larry Holmes, and he does it well

Superb Starker
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This collection of Italian Cello Sonatas by the great Janos Starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums I own.  The world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist Stephen Swedish on five of the selections, and by his frequent collaborator Gyorgy Sebok on the Bach Sonata in G minor, which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length (it is a welcome addition musically too).  The selections here range from famous composers like Bach, Boccherini and Vivaldi, to the lesser known Corelli, Locatelli and Valentini.  For me, the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of Starker.  Whether it is the happy bounce of the Vivaldi Allegro, the sublime rendering of the Boccherini Adagio, or the precise interplay with Sebok on the Bach Sonata, Starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich, full sound by the Mercury Living Presence recording technique.  This is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts

Close Your Eyes They're Back Again

Another solid 70's band that faded into obscurity. The nice thing about living in Canada was that we got to see all of the minor as well as the major acts. Edward Bear fell between the two. The original members got together in the late sixties and took their name from a more famous bear named Winnie. All of their hits are here as well as a cover of "Freedom for the Stallion" , a song that was also covered by "The Hues Corporation" and popularized by "Three Dog Night". Its mostly the type of music that most will remember a favourite love by from "The Last Song" to "Close Your Eyes" (I'm back again). A good middle of the road pop album to melt back the years

Did you know Foghat came from Savoy Brown?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I love "Fool For The City" I have also always loved Savoy Brown "Looking In" and didn't know until recently that Lonesome Dave was the singer and most of the Savoy Brown band went on to form Foghat. If you are a Foghat fan you should check out "Looking In" by Savoy Brown. If you've heard other stuff by Savoy Brown and didn't like it, don't be discouraged because "Looking In" (and only "Looking In") is essentially Foghat. There were a lot of changes in Savoy Brown personnel through the years and the guys that did Looking In were the best.

Joe Cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in R & B history.  He's always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties.  This collection is another classic with great covers from the Beatles, Elton John and Gary Wright.  His interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs, but in DTS 5.1, you are surrounded (as if in concert) by his presence.   The completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance.  Imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you'll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album

First of all i'm a die hard UFO fan,i own EVERY UFO album not just the michael shenker cd's...some of you fools reviewing the ufo albums without michael ..1) do the band a disservice 2)are smokin crack, and 3) are very inept in your musical judgement. While i'm a huge shenker fan he is far from the greatest guitar god,and i hate to break the news to ya's but for overall sound/effect and appeal paul chapmans just good as michael on many a song. That bein said MAKING CONTACT is one of the top five UFO albums MADE!!!! the top five UFO albums any fan should get are (PHENOMENON,LIGHTS OUT,NO PLACE TO RUN,MAKING CONTACT,and WALK ON WATER) along with the two live cd's BBC,and strangers in the night. Misdemeaner has some cool 80's guitar and is an attempt at mainstream(and they deserve to be mainstream) so who can blame them,and some of these songs are pretty cool...IF,I might add if you have an open mind (so that excludes most of you shenker diehards)...........

This is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time. Surprisingly, Evans' introspective style and Cannonball's soulful approach meld together perfectly. Perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are. Both The technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing. I've owned this CD for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings. Highlights are the amazing &quot;Waltz For Debby&quot; and Earl Zindars' waltz &quot;Elsa&quot;, easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written, in my opinion. You simply cannot go wrong with this CD

I remember thinking when this film came out that few things in life were as cool as Lloyd Dobler. This soundtrack is also one of those things. This album for me, as for many I'm sure, somewhat reflected my taste in music at the time, and even now actually. Of course the biggie here is "In Your Eyes" from Peter Gabriel. Who hasn't that track touched at some point? This also confirmed my love for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and here we get a slightly extended version of their classic "Taste The Pain". Toss on a few from Fishbone, Living Colour, and The Replacements and you solidify this soundtrack as a must own for the late 80's alt-rock lover. Not to mention the goods from Depeche Mode and Nancy Wilson (Heart). In fact the only thing that could've made this album any better, is if it ended with a "ding"

This era of Tangerine Dream (TD) was just great. The Virgin Years were truly a great period for TD. For me it deals with space and landscape. It's so close to repetitive music that would come much later. It's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies. You could fly with them and end up with more in the end. You can't say that for too many of these Electronic groups. After that period they would go on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards. It seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the same kind of concept. Great! They were an important link on the electronic scene. A great album! A great period

Good Stuff! An excellent collection of original and classic gypsy jazz tunes, artfully performed by Jorgenson. I recommend it as an introduction to the virtuosity of John Jorgenson and the genius of Django Reinhardt

Let me the say that the vocals on this cd may be painful at first, yet you get over them very quickly, except for a few spots. Even so, they do not lower my score for the album, and at times are quite catchy.

Funk meets experimental dissonance
</Text>

I'm not particularly familiar with Sonic Youth and the bits I've heard from their other albums haven't really grabbed me.  This does.  The rhythm section wouldn't be out of place in pseudo-tribal funk, the guitars are dissonant, jangling, sometimes hypnotically repetitive, and just plain weird, and the vocals are distant, airy, lazy.  Some of the best music I've heard in a good long while

Hilarious version of Lost Horizon!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This film came out in 1973 and I saw it in its original full length version (about 3hours and 15 min.) Executives from Columbia Pictures were there, it was the premeire, and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out(verbal) and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums. The executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across Columbus Circle in Boston and I and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free. We returned to the film and I have always loved this crazy redition of Lost Horizon, the miscasting, the terrible sets, the odd ball music for the story, the dubbed Liv Ullmann, the dance routines of Olivia Hussey..all of it. You cannot find a musical like it, or a soundtrack like it. Columbia execs were unimaginative; they should have believed in this film. The next day after this premeire in Boston, New York etc. (simultaneous I suppose) the film was cut, the posters were taken down..there was a ton of material to buy..T Shirts, dolls, posters of all sizes, bath towels with the poster on them, records of the sd tk of course, and small pop up sets of the entire film. It was to be a massive hit..In two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed, and the posters said, Last Two Weeks, and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared.

Toad The Wet Sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties. They wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable. BUT, there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste. My fave song is 'Is It For Me'. It is hard to classify them though. It sort of deep and meaningful (at most times) pop rock. Other good tracks include Walk On The Ocean, Pray Your Gods and I Will Not Take...etc. I regard this album and 'Dulcinea' as their two best albums

The Mother of All Film Scores...at Long Last!!!

This is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical, haunting scores ever composed for a film. Each succeeding track is a treat for the ears, refreshing and invigorating. Neeley and Varese Sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem.

Maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic.

With Engines of Creation, Joe Satriani did what he has always done: make the most of the tools he chooses to use.

His playing on this album reminds me of that of Bill Evans.  I am glad to see on reading all the reviews that someone else had that exact thought.  Comparison to Bill Evans is the best compliment I know how to give

Flash From My Past

I owned this as an LP and played it over and over on my tiny, mono phonograph.  I loved it then and I love it now. Rainmaker, I'm On My Way Back Home and Love Is All That I Ever Needed would all have been sucessful singles. I Would Have Loved You Anyway is the only song I don't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny. All the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that's ok! The background singers get a tad tiring but Go David Cassidy! I don't care if it's the memories or not, I enjoy putting this on and turning it up
