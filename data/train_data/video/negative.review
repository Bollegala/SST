The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the book!"  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.

A Politically-Correct Melodrama: A Definite Stinker
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did

PRIVATE RESORT is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid-80s when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres.  However, I'm sure this film is one that Johnny Depp, Hector Elizondo and Rob Morrow aren't proud to have on their resume.

I love this film.  It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing.  I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used.  I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches.  In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture.  I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves.  I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print .  One of  the worst I've ever seen

Interesting Script - Poor Acting

Fresh Horses, on paper, would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script. You had Molly Ringwald, with her porcelain skin and delicately curly red-blonde hair. You had Andrew McCarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through. You had a romantic triangle. You had the "class divide". The Brat Pack was loved by millions. How could this fail?

This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version.

While many of the details have been lost to time as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol to numb the pain caused by the first 40 minutes or so of this celluloid nightmare, there is just enough in my memory to offer a carefully crafted, yet sharply vitriolic rebuke of this horror.

Whenever I'm asked what is the worst movie I have ever seen, I quickly respond, "Cabin Boy." It is like a long, meandering, and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker. I would describe the plot, but there is none. I watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline, but it never came. It was written by a former staff writer for David Letterman, which is the only conceivable reason that Letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity. Even he later joked about how awful the movie was. Chris Elliott plays the only character he has ever played--the annoyimg dumb guy loser. His limited acting talent, combined with a nonsensical plot, unfunny dialogue, and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor, truly make Cabin Boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss

Ken Russell is a gifted director, as his erratic career has proved, but even the great Vanessa Redgrave can't save this one. "The Devils," a gaudy, loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism, went painfully awry. Grisly images of plague victims, quack cures, peculiar enemas, and Oliver Reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail--unfortunately, they are merely stomach-turning. A stocky, wild-eyed Oliver Reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as Father Grandier, the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century French town, and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake. Gemma Jones is one bright spot as Grandier's innocent love interest, and Ms. Redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of Sister Jeanne, but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing. Not for the faint of heart

The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat "hero" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed

Whiny Slackers Poke Reality With Stick - Reality Bites Back
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Reality Bites seemed fresh when it was first released, giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of "X" - that was overeducated, underemployed, plagued by the flashy, trashy commercialism of MTV, and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college.

If this is the generation I am supposed to belong to, I want to disown it.  Ben Stiller's directorial debut centers on four friends recently graduated from collage, and are now trying to find their way in the world.  The movies messege is that we are a lost generation, but that is not are parent's fault (where this movie tries to lay the blame).  The kids in this movie are just lazy, more or less.  And they spend their free time trying to make meaning out of their lives.  Indeed, Troy (Ethan Hawke) even tries to ratinalize stealing a candy bar by saying society ows him.  Winona Ryder plays waify Lelina, who makes a documentry out of recorded footage she has of her friends.  One day she meets Michael (Ben Stiller) who is their age but has made a good career out of the TV industry.  Ethan hates him for his honest approach to life, and so the battle for Lelina's love begins.  I really wasn't too impressed with this movie, it just made it seem like my peers are just wallowing in self pity for the sake of being the cool, tortured artist; when they should get off the couch and go get a job

Man, I don't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but it should be illegal!  This is, first off, a terrible DVD: 4:3 (full screen) format, with a dark, muddy picture.  Worse, the plot is typical, predictable, and poorly written.  Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.  That is probably the fault of the director, Erik Anjou, a third-rate director (at best!) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary.  Gee, I wonder why he isn't in more demand (NOT!)!

I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from.

"Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.

I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.

The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film

For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie

This is much more interesting as a visual chronicle of 1982 New York (there are generous aerial views, lots of location shooting, etc.) than as a horror movie, even a cheesy one.  The special effects are used extremely sparingly, with the word "special" being a definite overstatement.  Some amusing performances somewhat redeem the proceedings, but not by much.  In the end, "Q, The Winged Serpent" is watchable and certainly not horribly bad, but it's hard to imagine this being anybody's favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure.  To end on a positive note, the DVD features a clean, sharp print of the film.

I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch".

The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical

This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "undercover" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in "Lethal Weapon"), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell.

My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is

Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly

Davy Crockett TV   vs. Davy Crockett Movies
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I was very gung ho when I found out that Disney was finally releasing the Davy Crockett TV show on DVD.  I grew up watching the two Davy Crockett movies.  HOwever upon actually seeing these DVDs I was very disappointed.  It is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes.  The Episodes: Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter; Davy Crockett Goes to Congress; and Davy Crockett at the Alamo are all the parts included in the movie Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier.  The episodes Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race; Davy Crockett and the River Pirates; were what made up the movie Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.  I for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc.  The only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy Leonard Maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector's box.  The biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between $37-$100 whereas you can buy the two movies on DVD for $14-$16.  I myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately.

When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done.

The Forgotten starring Julianne Moore and Domnic West is a slow, tepid, and hard to grasp film. The previews for this film were better than the actual movie, I guess that's a bad sign that the movie isn't going to be great (I'll try and remember that next time). The only reason I am giving The Fogotten 2 stars is the scene with Alfe Woodward, you'll know what I mean when it happens, the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere, very intrguing spurprise awaits. Anyways The Forgotten is a movie you should see once and that's it, happy viewing

I have to disagree with the reviews above and say that I watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago. Unfortunately I couldn't find anything about this film I remember enjoying. It's a cross between The Blob, The Thing and a really crap detective movie. Moriarty's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80's kiddy movie. This film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you'll lose interest halfway through I guarantee it. No suspense, few laughs, and way to hokey to watch twice. If you love this movie you need to get out more.

Michael Moriarity is my hero! He is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion. He has done such great B-movies as this, Q, and It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive. How awesome is he?? Anyways, I think that this movie was hilarious! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously, thinking that it is going to be your typical movie. But you shouldn't because not only is this a B-movie, but IT IS supposed to be funny. My favorite part is when "the stuff" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it. Who would do that?? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened. So if you watch this movie, just sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth, don't be too critical on it.

Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.

RKO filed for bankruptcy in the mid-1930's and was on the verge of finally getting back on their feet financially by 1940. I suspect that someone from their cost accounting group wandered into the studio commissary in 1939 and found it full of under-contract actors and production staff goofing off and eating studio food. They rounded up this group, stuffed the whole bunch onto an unused sound stage (with a leftover southwestern set) and got them singing and dancing to songs from a Rogers and Hart Broadway show (which they had an option on but had deemed unworthy of feature film treatment).

An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;.  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman

The Pick-up Artist is a dangerously bad film. There is absolutely no chemistry between Robert Downey and Molly Ringwald. Molly Ringwald may have been of the most iconic 1980's female actresses, and she certainly proves her worth here. Ringwald looks too much of a virgin to me when her character wasn't supposed to be. That marks the moment when the film had lost its believably element. The real joke in this film has to be Robert Downey. His acting is insanely moronic. I often have to wonder if he wears a lipstick. I am pretty sure Robert Downey can make a great drag queen if he chose to. From the start to the end, I was annoyed. I couldn't see how Dennis Hopper and Danny Aiello got interested in this film and lend their hands in it. Harvey Keitel gives a fair performance, but I believe he is much tougher than that. Comparing Harvey Keitel's performance in Bad Lieutenant, Reservoir Dogs, and Mean Streets to The Pick-up Artist, it is enough to make an apparent observation that Harvey Keitel should have applied his talents to a more different film than this. A smaller film that he did rightfully apply his talent was Rising Sun, and he pulled that one off better than he did in this film. Why did they have to call it The Pick-up Artist? Could they give the movie a better title such as The Player

I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies.

The book is so much better!
</Text>
</title>
<text>

I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud

A slow, loggy movie about a philandering husband (everyone was guessing this was Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein in the Nora Ephron novel on which the movie is based; he was Ephron's husband). Jack Nicholson plays the husband and Meryl Streep the wife, and both are uncharacteristically bland. There is hardly anything to the story: they marry, she gets pregnant, he gets restless and wanders. We finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started. Very dull

This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him

This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story

I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant &quot;homemaker&quot;. If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too

Note: If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this. (I'm giving you fair warning now, so don't complain about spoilers later). The only reason I'm mentioning the ending and the "big secret" is because I'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment I experienced when watching this movie.                        When I first walked into the theatre to see this, I couldn't have been more excited; after months of waiting, I'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time I saw it! The movie started out wonderfully: great acting, scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds, and, at times, almost unbearable suspense (that Shyamalan really knows how to scare!)The story takes place in a small town in the 1800's. At first this town seems like the perfect place to live: the people are friendly, the houses are cozy, and the scenery is beautiful. Despite the peaceful setting, however, we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community, something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from  being completely at ease. Every now and then, they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village; nobody ever ventures into it, and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it. Pretty soon, we find out why: according to the village elders, there are dangerous, hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain. These creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village (it attracts them). For years, the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding: as long as the villagers stay out of the forest, the monsters will not harm them. At one point,however, one of the creatures enters the village at night, leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack. While all this is happening, we (the audience) still don't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are. It was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end: There are NO MONSTERS IN THE WOODS.  When one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words "It's all a farce", I still couldn't believe what I was hearing; it was all I could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre! After months of anticipating this film, of expecting a truly scary thriller, and of trying to guess what the monsters really are, THERE ARE NO MONSTERS! Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe it. It got worse, though. The next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the "monsters". The villagers aren't really living in the 1840's; they're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve. Supposedly, the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people, but when tragedy struck their families, they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new (if extremely delusional) life. The story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth. They even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real! When the retarded boy died in the woods (still wearing the stupid costume), the leaders, rather than mourning him, remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures. I basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them. What parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that? I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a movie before; not only was it completely misleading, but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were pathetic (I'm sorry, but I have no other word for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it). Many fans of this movie have said that those of us who didn't like it "don't get it". I assure you, I did get it, and I didn't like it anyway. I'm no fan of slasher films and I didn't expect this to be one, but I also don't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters. The two stars are for the cast and the filming. Better luck next time, guys

It could have been made better--less comedy and more plot and of course --action and suspense!!!!  Buy or rent on your own if you dare----I wouldn't

After purchasing this I have only been able to watch it once. Audrey Hepburn is my favorite all time actor/actress and she (Joanna in this) is brilliant as always. However, Albert Finney's roll (Mark), charactor and performance is in stark contrast. The further the movie goes the more I disliked Mark and was angry that Joanna was putting up with him. Mark's charactor is over the top and unbeliveable. Five stars Audrey, minus four Albert

It's about time for someone to make a strong pitch to Hollywood for a new version of "Fahrenehit 451".  Although I appreciate what Truffault was trying to accomplish back in the sixties, the movie just does not hold up well in 2007, particularly when shown in a high school classroom.  Advancements in CGI could transform Bradbury's novel into a very frightening and exciting thriller.  My students spent more time laughing at the adaptation than appreciating it thematically.  That being said, the book gained value exponentially to them because the movie didn't satisfy their understanding.  Lose the wires on the jet packs!

Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice

I couldn't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking.  The characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do? Mamet appears to have never left Manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective.  To be honest I didn't finish the entire film, but instead checked the TV Guide for reruns of Northern Exposure for the real thing

i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they needn't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors,jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing

Are You Kidding Me?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I saw this movie about two weeks ago and I can't believe how disappointed I am for this. I was expecting fireworks; instead I got a truckload of bad karma on my head. Not only that but it maybe the most over-the-top film I ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies I ever saw. To begin with half of the characters die in this film and I was like 'What is the meaning?' then there's the film's signature moment in which Sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera. Again I said to myself, 'What's the point?' And then there's the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the Kennedy assassination-from the scoped rifle right down to James Gregory's character getting shot in the head. In one of the documentries to this DVD director William Fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President Kennedy because 'Oswald realized that he was Raymond Shaw.' If he's right that raises the question: Did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over? Then Fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of "The Manchurian Candidate" and the death of President Kennedy are the two events that made the 1960's what it is and why people today (including me) are still obessed with that decade. In conclusion, I think this was a big disappoinment. And this movie is on the list of AFI's 100 greatest films? Please.

For any of you teachers out there who plan to watch this in your classroom with your students:  BEWARE!!  First of all, I've heard of taking "liberties" with a book but this is ridiculous! Sex between Farmer Jones and the neighbor farmer's wife is not in the book, but sure is shown in the movie.  I was shocked to see them rolling under the sheet as the headboard was "knocking against the wall". Utterly revolting and embarassing for me and my students.  I expect better from Hallmark Entertainment, Family Home Entertainment, etc...

Tootsie
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
To begin with the movie Tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.This movie is produced in New York. The protagonist is Michael Dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.The situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.For the reason that he cannot continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed  by that time. So there is where Dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous. He gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.In addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera. Thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing. He has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.The characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.THe way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear  women's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent. Because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work. The stes in the movie are really well done and I like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.The lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated. The costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.Furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting, there were not that much music but it was ok. This movie could be reall in life because  sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job.

this is pure drivel!!!!!clearly there was some kind of argument behind this film;like the director wasnt given enough money to make it,so he thought,you know what,im going to spite the film company by making a hideousely awful film,that'll show them.the &quot;plot&quot;,if i can re-tell it without vomiting,is thus:a plane is struck by lightning,and kills all the pilots..............i kind of lost what was going on after that......the ending,if there actually was one,was that whatever predicament they were in,they got out of.where can i begin?????clearly no one involved with this project has any knowledge of basic physics,as they'd have pointed out that this ISNT POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!im a little bit rusty on my physics,but isnt it called a faraday coil???if not then forgive me,my minds a little indestinct,but the main point is a bolt of lightning wont pass through a plane. &quot;what about the glass,it passed through the glass window!!!&quot; you bark smugly,well thick glass used for this wouldnt allow electric current to pass through it.think about it people,you ever been hit by lightning indoors??have you ever heard of this happening in real life before??NO,BECAUSE IT CANT!!!!!! well done,you're learning.anyway,enough of the banter,the film struggles from then on in.for some bizzare reason the plane operated by a laptop,the cable(??!!) for which has broken.it only works by some guy holding it with venom.factor into this some wierd pregnant woman type nonsense,some shouting passengers/helpful people arguing rubbish,a hint of romance between a &quot;criminal&quot; and a &quot;female human being&quot;,and you have this godawful tripe of a film.some wonderfully hilarious moments.guy says &quot;i skipped bail&quot;,&quot;are you a criminal?&quot; she asks!!!!!! well of course he is you stupid fool,he just told you!!!! any time there was &quot;turbulence&quot; the camera was wobbled about a bit,and the &quot;actors&quot; moved around unconvincingly.the terrible news report segments,where hilarity prevailed every time.the bit when the dog jumped out the car,that was brilliant!!!!he pushed it over a bit then it was half dead...then later he gave the oxygen mask,great!!!!! all the scenes involving the radar room,they were something else!!!!the ending also,the rubbish CGI aeroplane,what a laugh!!!!i could go on and on and on,pointing out rubbish but funny things about this film,but i think ive said enough.in short,dont come to watch this if you want a coherent engaging film.but if you enjoy laughing through mind-bogglingly bad trash,then this is definately for you!!!! i laughed nearly all the way through it,so at least it was entertaining.1 out of 5

Awful film barely saved by a couple of decent acting performances
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Next Generation is basically a remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical, though different characters and locations are used.  The original was a little overrated in my opinion and this "remake" is quite frankly terrible.  Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several B movie actors.  The only major differences from the original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy theory.

Texas Chainsaw Crapsacre

<Text>
This movie is far from being anything great. Some of the characters don't make any sense what so ever with the original cast. Leatherface's role has been mocked. People spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up Leatherface. The first TCM is a classic. And the second TCM is great as well. But Leatherface: TCM III, The Next Generation, and the TCM remake have all made the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise a laughing stock. I really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up. The only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with CGI. Enough is enough.

Is this really what most "normal people" call erotic?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is one of the most boring films I ever watched. There is nothing erotic in it. The whole story is perverted with a poor, innocent but very stupid woman submitting to the sadist fantasies of various "lovers" she is introduced. I put inverted comas in lovers because none of them have a single tender erotic moment with her, but instead they brutally beat her and rape her in the presence of others, who seem to be totally oblivious to the proceedings

I agree with most of the reviews here that the movie is just so bad. The director had the wrong idea of an art film, methophors and strange incoherrent ending is not the only thing you need to make an art film. I was pretty intrigued by the lead's obssession with the Hunky Swimmer but it just did not end the movie satisfactorily ...

If you crave a gay-themed film full of brooding obsession, gloomy (and very well done) night photography, the occasional graphic sex scene, and METAPHORS so obvious even a high school film class could catch them, then this just might be your cup of tea. Howewver, if you are looking for a film that sustains its running time and subject, then you are out of luck.

Beautiful Boy, Pretentious Director
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This picture is a mess of misused metaphors and confused imagery from start to finish.  I was left scratching my head wondering who these people are and why they behave the way they do. Forgive me for expecting the film to provide any answers.   First the good news - if you like beautiful boys, Ricardo Meneses as the twisted Sergio is one of the most gorgeous creatures to ever stand naked before a lens.   Despite the hopelessly confusing script, his acting (such as it is) is amazing, especially if you take into account his age (18) and experience (his first film). It's too bad he had to be "discovered" by a director who thinks nothing of making his audience beg for each scrap of insight, and pretentiously expects the viewer to read their own interpretation into whatever nonsense he sees fit to set up as his next scene. I wanted to give it the benefit of a doubt, so after sitting through one screening of this erotically charged but confused tangle of a movie, I sat through it again, this time with the directors commentary on. Cheating, I know, but after shelling out all that money for the DVD I was hoping to gain some idea of what the hell was going on. I emerged from watching it the second time half in love with the beautiful young actor Ricardo Meneses, but with only a fraction of the respect I had for the director, Joao Pedro Rodrigues, after my first screening. And that wasn't much.

No Point & Very Blank
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
As I recall, 1967 was not the most prolific year for movies and Point Blank,in my opinion, would be one of the worst films I have ever watched.  Notwithstanding the very violent nature of the film, the acting by such notables as Lee Marvin, Carroll O'Conner and Angie Dickinson continually appear to search for conviction with their dis-jointed and nonsensical dialogue.

Bernard Hermman's score is magnificent.  This was a major let down for me considering it was directed by Truffaut.  Lacked any real suspense and edge.  Boring camera work for the most part.  Some nice editing touches here and there but overall pretty lackluster.  The acting was fine...I guess.  It was just a pointless story I felt that really didn't go anywhere.  And what was with that crummy ending

another failure with Dolph Lundgren

</title>
<text>
<Text>
Dolph Lundgren (Universal Soldier, Blackjack) plays a man who is hired to take out a primary target and helping him is his old partner, Gina Bellman. Soon things heat up as the two security guards working at the building they are at start to get fiesty and one of them takes drugs and sees spiders and stuff. The 2 are also in a heated romance and get caught in a deadly cat and mouse game of double cross as the agency they are working for want them dead. Another Dolph Lundgren stinker vehicle though Lundgren can't act if his life depended on it. He couldnt pull of He-Man and The Punisher, he can't pull off anything else. Gina Bellman is hot but her acting is horrible as well as the rest of the cast. There's nothing like being hired to kill people and then have sex. Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander). Bottom line is this actioner is a borefest

I am completely befuddled that anyone with any love for the book could enjoy this movie. It is merely a monument to Hollywood's stunning inability to read or to understand the simplest moral tale. In Dumas's book the Count learns that he cannot play God--dispensing punishments to the evil and rewards to the good--because of the complex ways in which the wheat and the tares are intertwined in this earthly life. He abandons his project of perfectly just revenge and accepts a new love as a gift from a mysteriously merciful God.

Didn't Really Do It For Me
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense.

All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place.  Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized.  Has the art of "posing" been lost by modern girls?  Maybe all the good directors have retired or died!  What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.

I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..

Wonderful program, but flawed files...

<text>
<Text>
Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.

For Jarheads

I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead.  I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military.  For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested.  As someone else mentione.  I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't..

Resuscitating a Classic Movie with a Lacking, Lethargic Sequel Three Decades Later
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when I can see a bright future for Jennifer Aniston's light comedic talents, even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure "Friends" persona. She plays Sarah Huttinger, a likeably insecure New York Times obituary writer going home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie's wedding. Sarah is picture-pretty, 33 and engaged to a nice, unflappable guy named Jeff who accompanies her. At the same time, she's unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family. A ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family, her feisty, tart-tongued grandmother Katherine, who tells Sarah about her late mother's pre-wedding tryst in Mexico that gives rise to questions about Sarah's paternity.

maybe i'm spoiled by big-budget sci-fi films, but i thought this movie kind of stunk. it felt and looked like a TV movie and wasn't scary, at all. the best/funniest part was how no one could remember the one lady's name or face, and everyone described her the same way--"the one with the glasses." "Oh, her--haven't seen her." LOL

M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" is a noteworthy example of how the technique of misdirection can be employed in cinema.  However, the mere use of misdirection does not guarantee that a film will wind up being any good.

I'm an animation fan, and when this came up recommended to me I was eager to check it out. While the animation was fine (although a tad creepy), I found the story off-putting. Its basically about a bunch of dysfunctional people on drugs in a depressing future where there are a lot of people doing drugs a.k.a substance "D."  I found  this film depressing and annoying. I particularly found the 'blur suit' to be distracting to watch. It almost gave me a headache.

This movie is NOT for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird.

If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO

Big Bird too whiney
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought this DVD for my daughter who is from China and though I think Xiao Foo is adorable, I am disappointed by Big Bird's behavior. Not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way, but he tells Barkley at one point to "sic" the Monkey King and then later, again frustrated, tells the Monkey King to put his dukes up (as if to fight to resolve the issue). I am appalled by this.  Big Bird is also somewhat demeaning to the Chinese people he encounters--they don't understand him because he is speaking English and rather than explain the language barrier, he just gets upset. I love Sesame Street, and although I will keep this DVD to hear Xiao Foo sing in Chapter 7 (our daughter just loves her), I feel I will need to use Big Bird's behavior as an example of how not to act

Not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered!!! Not a single one! Since I refuse to watch it again, I now have to go to bed asking myself if I didn't perhaps miss something.

It was just like a homemade movie with really bad sound. I looked around the room and the other two people watching it with me had fallen asleep.

[2.5]--Cheese-la-Weez What Happen Here?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
As curious as I was about this movie it had me dazed. The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot.

This movie,   the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it,  is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime.   The modern day portion of the movie is very tedious.    Elizabeth Hurley's and Sean Penn's characters are laughable caricatures.    Anita Shreve's writings never disappoint,   read the book instead.

This was a critically lauded film, so when I went in, I had high expectations.  Roger Ebert himself called it a masterpiece.  I saw it, and it was certainly interesting, but I immediately forgot about it right after I left the theater.  There really isn't much depth here.  It's more reminiscent of getting a quick rush from something, then after it wears off, you don't even remember how you felt afterwards.  I remember a scene where a cow is blown up, but other than that, it's hard for me to remember anything about it.  It ultimately was very ordinary, and not a really deep film about war.

Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for

VE2 has a ton of potential, but it just doesn't work out.  Brandy Davis is both cute and sexy, of course, but Playboy's Testing the Limits is a much better showcase for her, um, talents.  Not to be mean, but most of the film's other women just aren't that attractive, and many of the sex scenes are actually irritating because of the obnoxious soundtrack.  Contrary to a previous reviewer, the massage scene is fairly ordinary.  The girl-girl stripper scene is the most disappointing, however.  It starts really well, with the straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness and enjoying the stripper, but even the unrated version then fades to black without any real action.  The only scene worth watching at all is blue-collar vignette, with two girls and one guy hooking up. Stay away from this one

Jeunet shot himself in the foot with this nonsense. I admire his attempt to create something cutting edge though. Personally I didn't see the whole film, I walked out before the ending. Audrey Tautou is probably one of France's least talented actresses. Yes, I know we all loved her in Jeunet's single sucessful film Amelie which is probably the only film of hers that most American's have seen but please, the girl can barely act, has no presence and no joie de vivre. Since Amelie had it's success Tautou has appeared in no less than a dozen terrible movies, the foreign shelf at Blockbuster is lined with them.

Jeremy Brett was by this time indeed &quot;the dying detective,&quot; but  his real-life condition in no way helps this tedious and undramatic  rendition of one of Conan Doyle's more tasteless Holmes stories. The  original features some of Holmes' worst and most insensitive treatment of  poor Watson, but since this series made such a thing of their friendship,  the adapters have a heck of a time getting around it. Stick with the Brett  episodes from the mid-80s, when he was fresh in the role and the  adaptations were true and intelligent

I watched Anger Management on the plane. Since there is nothing else to watch, and the flight is more than ten hours, you usually watch whatever is on T.V. I thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad, though there are some funny parts. There is some offensive language. Overall, it's a bad movie and is not worth watching.

More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff

The Beginning of Disappointment
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
As a big fan of Ralph, I was looking forward to The End of the Affair.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but this movie is dreadful.  Ralph is a brilliant actor, but not even his flawless acting can't compensate for the nonsensical plot and the horrific casting of Julianne Moore.  What happened to Moore?  It is NOT hard to learn a British accent.  From the sounds of it, Moore didn't even try.  She sounds so American she fails to convince anyone she has an ounce of English in her.  And if that weren't bad enough, the plot is as unconvincing as Moore's accent.  She's an adulteress, but miraculously heals a young boy's facial disfigurement and brings Ralph back from the dead. Even the priest admires her--adultery and all! Her husband does not know the meaning of jealously and lets Ralph live in the house even though he knows of the affair.  Still amidst the unbelievable, the plot is so predicatable.  She coughs a few times here and there.  So we know (before anyone in the movie figures it out) that she's dying.  We also know why she &quot;ends&quot; the affair long before its &quot;revealed&quot; to Ralph. And by the way, what was with all the nudity?  Totally unnecessary and vulgar

It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her

There are bad movies, and then there are BAD movies. "Universal Soldier: The Return" is a cosmically bad movie, a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to "Manos: The Hands of Fate" for comparison. The first "Universal Soldier" film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and "Rocky" refugee Dolph Lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do: people perished in violent ways, stuff exploded, and Van Damme and Lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film. Even the presence of the charming Ally Walker as Van Damme's female sidekick greatly helped the film. The movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition DVD some time back. It unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel. The second, and one hopes final, installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that I sat in open-mouthed awe watching it. I think I can safely say I am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity. Expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll.

This sure sounded like a hot movie when i read the overview. A young woman curious about sex and trying to get herself off. Boy,i sure was surprised at what this really is. A super softcore B-movie with terrible acting and almost no sex!!! You want nudity? Sorry. But this movie does have worms,thats right, worms! In one of the "Sex scenes" a guy puts live worms into the womans private area. Yeah,it's that bad. Stay far away from this one

I liked the original movies, with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman. with that being said here is why i really didn't like this movie.

Read the book - it takes less time!

<text>
<Text>
The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film

Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.

Represents an ad nauseam theme of post-60s Hollywood.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Like so many Hollywood movies -- especially anything made after the late 60s, when America's teen-agers and collegiate students started taking their typically youthful antiestablishmentarianism with them into the future -- this is another passionate rage against the allegedly oppressive machine.  See The Shawshank Redemption, see Dead Poet's Society, see With Honors -- filmdom's lock-step march against authority is a mainstay of the past three or four decades.  Naturally, this movie is revered as something of a paragon if not a modern pioneer of the trend.  In regular Hollywood fashion, Nurse Ratched (the chief antagonist) and the cuckoos' restrictive environment are portrayed with just enough ambiguity to deflect charges that the movie is a paranoid feast for leftist sensibilities -- which it is, of course.  Unlike most fare of this sort, it is at least very competently crafted (the director and the actors sympathize with the source material enough to give it their all), which no doubt explains how it won one or two more of those little golden trophies than it would have gotten otherwise.  -- M. Cooper

Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Talk of Angels&quot; could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest

I wasn't expecting Disney, but I was less than thrilled by this feature.  I'm assuming there's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it.  Many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story.

Not that I know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM made it look too easy. Performances by Michael Caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and Will Patton as  the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on  television.  But A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM needed to close a few holes in its  story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment

Two moderately decent-looking white people who apparently aren't very good at sex go at it in this movie. If that's your thing, why not just rent a bad softcore porn film and be done with it? At least then you won't have to listen to the cornball pseudo-artistic dialogue in this film. What a crock. They could at least have cast a fine young sista like Rosario Dawson or Gabrielle Union to make this movie moan and squeal! This movie makes sex seem boring

This was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It didn't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters. The plot and scripting are  incredibly weak, it seems the editors just stopped mid-movie and rolled the  credits there. The CGI dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their  animation was very stiff. In my opinion, not worth the $83 it costs

I can respect director Adam Marcus for trying to pull away from the series and do something different, but we already had the BS Ft13th movie: Part V.  Jason wasn't the killer.  Technically, Jason is the killer in this movie, but it's not really.  You'll see what I mean when you see the movie, and it is worth a see, but by the 7th or 8th movie, they were movies for the fans.  They stopped making them to be innovative by the 5th movie and were just making them to make money and entertain the audience.  Adam Marcus wanted to be innovative with Jason Goes to Hell, and it doesn't work.  Not for fans or an average audience.  There's nothing interesting about seeing random people who act like Jason walking around and killing people, not to mention WITHOUT the trademark machete.  They could've at least given these people a little personality with the machete, but whoever called that one thought they were doing the series a favor.  The introduction of Jason having a sibling, niece, and now a great niece (I think?) by the 9th movie in the series is a little too late, sorry.  We would've had to know about these people by at least the 3rd or 4th movie to make us care about their struggle.  Another thing:  Jason as a snake/demon creature crawling around the floor?  Hmm... I wasn't under the impression that Jason was really evil in the first place.  Let me explain:  Jason has been made out to be mentally/physically disabled.  If Ginny in Part 2 was able to convince him that she was his mother by wearing her sweater, than Jason isn't evil at all, he just loves his mom and kills all the victims because he believes that they're responsible.  So, Jason as a wierd little hell creature doesn't necessarily work when bringing it into the context of the other movies.  The design of Jason's actual appearances in the movie doesn't make sense either.  What happened between part 8 and 9 to get his mask somehow buried and melded into his face?  Why does he look fat?  Where did his hair come from?  At least Part 8 had some respect for the look and personality of Jason, while it might not have been the best in the series it was at least satisfying to see him the way we know him, and not make drastic changes which don't even benefit his appearance.  Adam Marcus, I can respect you for trying to make your own movie, and yeah, it's definately yours.  Don't try and make your own movie the 9th movie in a series of movies that are about the fans, and don't BS the fans with your idea of an improvement of the series.

What this film has is an interesting premise and storyline but unfortunatley it becomes to silly and ridicoulos and the car chase scenes didn't help either. Bruce Willis plays the part of a psychologist that while on vacation visits a friend of his Bob Moore who is also a psychologist and is later murdered and the chief suspect is in his therapy group, Bob is determined to find the killer and is also helped by a detective. There is also a young atractive woman played by Jane March who gets involved with Bruce willis's character Dr. Bill Capa, the films only intresting thing is the therapy group itself which has some odd characters otherwise the film was a lame attempt of being a thriller. Now I'm not a big fan of Bruce Willis but I have seen much better films with him in it than this including Die hard trilogy, last man standing and the sixth sense

Great Routines, Too Fast Moves
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This video has some very effective routines, but the moves are performed much too fast for safe form.  Because they are done so fast, injuries can incur.  She starts out slowly but quickly go into, what she calls, super sets.  I have several videos, and that is definitely not the proper way to super set.  Normally, you could modify the moves by performing them slower, but, because they are time crunch workouts (about 10 minutes each segment), you really don't have the time to do that.  Definitely, not one of her better videos.  The routines are easy, but because of the improper form used, not recommended for the beginner, as it could do my damage then good.  If you are a Denise Austin fan (even though her voice is a bit annoying and this is not one of her better videos, she's still a great instructor), try one of her Hit The Spot segments.

Van Damme fans only...

I struggle with this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, so part of me really likes this movie. But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks. If this appeals to you, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't like "Desert Heat." If even one of this doesn't sound good, stay far away

Parents, Think Twice!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The only thought in my mind throughout this whole movie was the Natalie Holloway case, about the girl last summer that went on that school trip, went off with a boy and disappeared. In this movie, Hilary Duff's character is on a school trip to Rome, meets a guy there and then fakes sick to get away from the school group to follow this guy around Rome. I felt so bad that Disney had made this movie showing a young girl going off on her own with a boy she did not know on a school trip because it rang so close to home from that tragic dissappearance of Natalie Holloway. In this movie the only repurcussions the character gets for doing such completely unsafe acts was that she was grounded..and they didn't even show that part. Young girls are very impressionable and will jsut see the glamour in the movie. Hopefully they will be brough up by good parents that will teach them right to know better than to go off with a stranger in a strange place

I read this book for a project two years ago. I wasn't about to finish this book and had to move to another one. First off, this book lacks emotion. This character is so boring.

Just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children; movies have ratings for a reason.  This movie is rated PG-13, which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for children.  In this case, it is crude humor.

Wonderful program, but flawed files...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.

The animation was very poor quality... the music was not the focus, my grandchildren lost interest. Shat else could possibly have been wrong

Unfortunately, I was sent a standard American copy of the movie which, of course, doesn't function on a european system, despite my adress beeing in Switzerland. So I was kind of disapointed to have a)lost the money b)not been able to watch the movie. One is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible DVD player.

Painful
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
From the cover, this movie looked like a fun mixture of Cruel Intentions and Metropolitan. No such luck. I think the biggest problem in this movie was the script-- the writing was so bad that it was actually painful to listen to the dialogue. Though there are some normally fine actors in this cast, it would have been impossible to triumph over the poor script, and the cast as a whole seemed strangely void of emotion, except for a few moments of melodrama. I found myself hating even the characters we were supposed to sympathize with. Delilah, who is supposed to be the "fun, crazy" outsider, simply disgusted me with her actions at the movie's central party. Even the art direction in this movie was strange-- many pivotal scenes in the movie were shot from very far away. The strangeness of this movie is not intentional, it's just lack of skill. Stay away

I'm a fan of Audrey Hepburn and this movie relys heavily - too heavily on her charm.  And unfortunately, it is some of her worst acting work, posey, sing-song, and superficial.  Now, if you've read her bio, and know what was going on with her and Holden, that could explain it, but still, this film is very static.

It's always nice to watch Famke Janssen, of course, but I like it better when she's either a very smart X-Person or a Bond-busting sadist.  This movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh.  And the bad guy was like an evil version of Sgt. Carter from Gomer Pyle - totally implausible.  I think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them

This isn't funny. It isn't well directed or scripted. Perhaps it could have been great, if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director, but it didn't, so it turned out mediocre at best. Unfortunately, I believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and I to watch. I told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews I'd read, this was going to be a brilliant, hilarious cult classic. But now that we've watched it, he and I both know better. We know it's dreadful, and I can only imagine all the nice things I'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity. The only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and I got into halfway through the movie about where we'd seen one of the actors in the movie before. I'm pleased to say I won the argument. That was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me.

I don't think so.  Contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script.  Think about it: take a dump on a stock and get wiped out; now you are a messenger?  I do not think so.  I know of a few New York Stock Exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades, but this is crazy.  Thank goodness they kept the New York scenes to a minimum.  Yes, he was suppose to be at the NYSE and not the Pacific Stock Exchange as a previous reviewer wrote

Death of a Series
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
With "Death on the Nile," the producers of the A&E "Poirot" series can claim to have broken all ties with the original British program starring David Suchet, save the presence of the star. The qualities that made the original program endearing-the wit, the exquisite production design, the fastidious attention to detail, the superb character acting of both the regulars and guests-are gone. That is not to say that this new Poirot is completely devoid of redeeming qualities, just that they pale in comparison with the original series.

To be quite honest, although there was a stunning cast, the plot was gory. It was sweet and had it's element of romance, but it was too morbid for me to enjoy. If you are watching for Drew Barrymore, don't bother. she only  appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards.  Dean Cain on the other hand looks mighty fine, if you're after a gay man.  It's not the type of movie you want your children to watch. Trust me

My SECOND review, as my first did not get printed (AS USUAL).  Anyway, I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I usually try and give credits to directors, producers, writers, and actors in most of my movie reviews; however, I'm going to make an exception here.  I've read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd "hilarious", "Night of the Living Dead + money + color", "wonderful for gorehounds", etc., etc., etc.  All I can say is it must not take much to please you people.

What i mean by the title of my review is yes this movie is going to be funny its Monty Python! but there is also some parts where it just really gets out of hand in my mind. If you are new to Monty Python I would get the quest for the holy grail before this one. Also the Monty Python's Flying Circus is great too. It comes in a 16 DVD set so it will give you a lot of their old stuff. I really did not enjoy certain parts. But there is a few good moments.

This is one creative way in which to recoup some of the loss incurred by buying this nightmare. If you are one of the unfortunate who rent this waste of time(like I was) recommend that your local video store make one empty space on their shelves and toss this loser. This 71 minute "experience", which feels more like 100 Days of Viewing Hell, is nothing more then a montage of artsy, disjoined, surreal scenes. It quickly becomes boring after the first 5 minutes, tedious after 10 minutes, and downright irritating at around 15 minutes. I actually made the mistake of suffering through to the end, hoping that something magical would happen to make everything half-way understandable. This film could only appeal to the rare, artistically elite, filmgoer who finds anything as superficial as character development or cumbersome as plot layout simply uninspiring

I saw this on TCM years ago and i thought what is all the fuss about. I do not like how it glorifies that leaving your wife and kid is swell. The men look more like lady's then the men in this movie that are after her. Also this movie is so long and boring. Don't get me wrong i like foreign films even the ones that are slow like wild strawberries, umberto d and such but this one did nothing for me. Another thing his wife is alot more actrative then the woman he desires. You can tell i did not mention character names well i forgotten them i only seen this moive me once and that was enough. A other thing i need to mentin why is that criterion charges so much for there dvds other dvds are restored as well and they are cheaper and most of chiterion dvds do not even have a whole lot of bonus features

Both Stars are for D'Onofrio

I too bought this on VHS for Vincent D'Onofrio.  My only negative comment about his performance is that there's not enough of it!  I'll say right here and now that I'm not a big fan of Smits or Scacchi, and D'Onofrio overpowers them every time he's on screen.  It's a beautiful story, and I can see why director Gillian Armstrong was attracted to it - it is a love story with a bit of real-life depth (rather than those soapy ones where the ridiculous problems are created by the characters for lack of imagination - Julia Roberts films, anyone?).  That being said, the two lead roles needed to be played by stronger actors, and ones that could keep up with D'Onofrio vivacity.  Worth a look for fans

</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Every once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known actor/actress in it that everything will turn out good. Blue Steel is one of those movies. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties (or should I say murders) which she did not commit. Sounds like an interesting plot, right? It would be had the script not been so poorly written. The supporting actors give such a bland/typical performance that not even Jamie Lee could have saved the dialogue. Aside from the acting, the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises. Some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop (Jamie Lee) is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her. So why do I give Blue Steel an extra star? Well, I'll just say that if you are a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television. Just don't pay over $3 to rent it and certainly don't buy it

I am a huge fan of BBC period drama and have nearly exhausted my library's supply of miniseries based on the works of Austen, Gaskell, Dickens, and Eliot. But I would have to say that the BBC struck out this time. The direction was bad, the acting was mediocre at best, the music was obtrustive, and the screenplay was just plain awful. After the first half-hour my sisters and I survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another. I have not read the book so I don't know how much of it is from the source material. Makes me curious to read it, though. The costumes and some of the scenery were good; I'll give it that

I was very unimpressed with this movie. "Borat" suffers from the same delusion as Sarah Silverman in thinking that crass or politically incorrect AUTOMATICALLY equals funny. It does not. Of course sometimes it can be hilarious (and Borat does have moments like that), but overall I did not find this movie particularly funny or even amusing. Especially the scene where the naked friend sits on Borat's face was just disgusting and it dragged on and on and on. At some point I just fast forwarded it. You're not missing much if you don't watch this movie

<Text>
Back in the early 90's, Jane March made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit The Lover. Granted, the role didn't give her much to work with, but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers, including me. The movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring-board into a legitimate movie career. Unfortunately, choosing the unbelievably stupid Bruce Willis vehicle Color of Night as her follow-up probably killed any chance at a career that she had.

What this film has is an interesting premise and storyline but unfortunatley it becomes to silly and ridicoulos and the car chase scenes didn't help either. Bruce Willis plays the part of a psychologist that while on vacation visits a friend of his Bob Moore who is also a psychologist and is later murdered and the chief suspect is in his therapy group, Bob is determined to find the killer and is also helped by a detective. There is also a young atractive woman played by Jane March who gets involved with Bruce willis's character Dr. Bill Capa, the films only intresting thing is the therapy group itself which has some odd characters otherwise the film was a lame attempt of being a thriller. Now I'm not a big fan of Bruce Willis but I have seen much better films with him in it than this including Die hard trilogy, last man standing and the sixth sense

Why does Jet Li star in Wong Jing films?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This film has been re-released as "Meltdown."  There are a few reasons for watching this movie: 1) Jet Li.  2) Chingmy Yau (the reporter).  3) Wu Ma (Frankie's dad)  4) a decent fight scene at the end.  Jacky Cheung is also not as aggravating as usual.   That's it.  Jet Li has appeared in three or four films directed by Wong Jing, and, just as Chow Yun Fat does in God of Gamblers and Jackie Chan does in City Hunter, he does what he can.  The direction of the film, however (as well as GOG and CH), stinks.  The plot copies Die Hard and Speed, with some broad satire aimed at Jackie Chan, but that is not the problem.  Put simply, Jackie Chan knows how to direct a film.  Wong Jing does not.  If you want to see Jet Li, go see Fist of Legend, Once Upon A Time in China, or just about anything else he has done.  If you want to see a good Hong Kong action movie, watch films directed by John Woo, Ringo Lam, Tsui Hark, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung.  Jet Li is fun to watch, but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this

The plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language.   This could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated.   It is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting.   Dying Young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful.  Falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality.   I threw it in the trash as I would not share it with those that I love

Everthing about this movie was bad.  The Acting, the story, the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor.  The acting and production value was so bad that you'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975.  How much did it cost them to film this movie?  50 bucks?  The Revenge of the Nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with

a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film.  its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect?  there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here.

1.75 STARS: It's hard to give this movie any credit.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
After watching "Anthropophagus- The Grim Reaper", I came away with mixed feelings.  On the one hand, "Anthropohagus" had its moments (albeit quite few) where it was somewhat chilling.  The Anthropohagus, himself, was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain.  Some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror, but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between.  Unfortunately, the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie, and for some reason, it is just very difficult to get over this fact in "Anthropophagus" probably because these weaknesses are so glaring.

Yes, I must admit that I was fooled by the "One of the most notorious, most debated, most banned films of the 'video nasty' era." line on this back of this movie case.  I was lucky because I found this at a Best Buy for $10.99.  It should be $2.99 for as bad as it is.  I've been let down by these Italian Horror Films one too many times.  If you want good, gore filled, Italian Horror stick with Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento.  Once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they're berrible.  Oh, by the way, unless you are fluent in Italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have English subtitles.  The only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language

A selfish, stupid woman engages in white collar crime, and goes to prison for her misdeed. I say stupid, because she could have paid a modest fine and gotten away with her crime, but chose instead to gamble with her and her family's future by trusting her lot to a jury of her peers. They judged her as harshly as I did.

Save your $3.50 DVD rental fee. If you're looking for a movie that will make you feel like City of Angels made you feel, look elsewhere! Sorry, my vote is for Hollywood. The director of Wings admits that there was no script before shooting began. The extras that came with the Wings DVD, interviews and info on Berlin, were more entertaining than the movie.

Big Bird too whiney
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought this DVD for my daughter who is from China and though I think Xiao Foo is adorable, I am disappointed by Big Bird's behavior. Not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way, but he tells Barkley at one point to "sic" the Monkey King and then later, again frustrated, tells the Monkey King to put his dukes up (as if to fight to resolve the issue). I am appalled by this.  Big Bird is also somewhat demeaning to the Chinese people he encounters--they don't understand him because he is speaking English and rather than explain the language barrier, he just gets upset. I love Sesame Street, and although I will keep this DVD to hear Xiao Foo sing in Chapter 7 (our daughter just loves her), I feel I will need to use Big Bird's behavior as an example of how not to act

Van Damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in Double Team. with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said HEY!!!! damnit, lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here

Shockingly Revisionist and Doctrinaire View of Jazz History
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music "self-indulgent bullsh**" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's "Fair and Balanced" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there

Along with The English Patient, this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed' films I have ever had the displeasure of viewing

This is not the first interview that Fra. Junge has given. View the sensational 1974 documentary, "The World At War,' narrated by Lord Laurence Olivier, and you will see a much younger Junge musing over her tenure with Hitler. Most of the information that she provides in this documentary was given in "The World At War." The 1974 documentary is filled with footage of Hitler. Having had relatives who were in Germany at the time, and personally knowing former German soldiers and officers, I find it difficult to believe that Junge did not know of the Nazi Death camps as both rumors and hard evidence surfaced while they were going on. I believe she knew but because of the fact that she was so taken by Hitler, perhaps she did not want to believe the rumors. My mother personally met Hitler when she was 15 and was totally mezmerized by his apparent charm and grace. At any rate, "Blind Spot" repeats "The World At War" interviews, and is a "talking head" that would have been better produced with raw footage with voice-over. The three stars is for effort, minus one star for "nothing new" and minus another star for German and not English (English sub-titles). The younger Frau spoke good English in 1974 but is lost in "Blind Spot."  S

Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.

I learned long ago to ignore and laugh at the positive and negative feedback that a reviewer gets.  Obviously my one star review of this movie will get negative feedback but that doesn't make my opinion any less valid.  It is, after all, my honest opinion, and therefore it is worth something to someone, if only to me.  Sometimes I agree with Ebert, and sometimes i completely disagree with him.  I think we all believe in our hearts that "I" am the only one with the correct opinion.  I would subscribe to that myself.

I was very disappointed with this film.

Only Worth the second stop-motion sequence, when Flesh fights a robot twig. That scene is almost flawless and as good as any Harryhausen animation. The one love scene with Flesh and the hot curvy brunette is also nice. The film is worth a rent if your curious but it's really just a lame and unfunny movie. If your open to seeing a trashy sci-fi satire of Flash Gordon with some interesting special effects give it a look. Especially fans of stop-motion animation in which the film features 3 creature sequences

It's always nice to watch Famke Janssen, of course, but I like it better when she's either a very smart X-Person or a Bond-busting sadist.  This movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh.  And the bad guy was like an evil version of Sgt. Carter from Gomer Pyle - totally implausible.  I think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them

NOT for Rogers and Hammerstein Fans...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Rogers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella" is one of my favorite musicals ever! But does this rendition do it justice? Absolutely not!!!!! More glitz and fancier costumes do not a make a better musical by any means. Maybe if I was not enamored with Leslie Ann Warren or Julie Andrews who make far better Cinderellas I would have enjoyed this. I am not against a politically correct image like this story attempts but if it was done tastefully i would have appreciated it better. If you are a Rogers and Hammerstein fan like I am, you want to watch it anyway but its not merely as charming as the other ones. Its ALOT more exciting that the Julie Andrews version was recently found save your money and buy that one. However a younger audience or an audience that was not enamored with the other Rogers and Hammerstein Cinderellas will appreciate it far better

I must admit that I am a guy and that I bought this movie before seeing it. I was not shocked with the horrible acting, but was surprised with the hot stars. This movie had both hot guys and girls. The actor that caught my eye was Steven Albrecht "Freddy", he is so hot. We get see him completely nude showing off his hot body.  He did a great job in his breif scene. Josh Edwards "Trian" was okay to look at too. As for the actress...Venesa Taylor is also hot

Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.

i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they needn't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors,jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing

Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back

This movie,   the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it,  is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime.   The modern day portion of the movie is very tedious.    Elizabeth Hurley's and Sean Penn's characters are laughable caricatures.    Anita Shreve's writings never disappoint,   read the book instead.

I don't know what's up with all of these 4-5 star reviews. This movie was awful. There was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag. Not even the guest appearances by Afrika Bambataa, Melle Mel, and the Rock Steady Crew could save it. I couldn't wait for it to be over with. The "graffiti" throughout the movie was absolutely awful. Ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair. Guy Davis was fine back then, but not anymore. Rae Dawn Chong was just annoying. This is one movie I never want to see again

Zed (Sean Connery) hitches a ride inside of a giant, flying, stone head. Once aboard, he shoots it's occupant dead and flies off to "The Vortex", a place where the "Eternals" live. This is a land full of men and women who have no sense of what real living is all about. They just loll around, musing and pontificating about nothing. Zed spices things up for these immortal buffoons by being different and, oh yeah, by having a male organ that works! I kid you not! The rest is mainly Zed finding out that what he thought would be heaven is actually pretty dull. Unfortunately, so is this movie! John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur) wrote, produced, and directed this elephant tranquilizer. Although, it does get an extra star for that hilarious flying head..

Why does Jet Li star in Wong Jing films?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This film has been re-released as "Meltdown."  There are a few reasons for watching this movie: 1) Jet Li.  2) Chingmy Yau (the reporter).  3) Wu Ma (Frankie's dad)  4) a decent fight scene at the end.  Jacky Cheung is also not as aggravating as usual.   That's it.  Jet Li has appeared in three or four films directed by Wong Jing, and, just as Chow Yun Fat does in God of Gamblers and Jackie Chan does in City Hunter, he does what he can.  The direction of the film, however (as well as GOG and CH), stinks.  The plot copies Die Hard and Speed, with some broad satire aimed at Jackie Chan, but that is not the problem.  Put simply, Jackie Chan knows how to direct a film.  Wong Jing does not.  If you want to see Jet Li, go see Fist of Legend, Once Upon A Time in China, or just about anything else he has done.  If you want to see a good Hong Kong action movie, watch films directed by John Woo, Ringo Lam, Tsui Hark, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung.  Jet Li is fun to watch, but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this

Jane should have boffed the ape instead. Jane and papa head through the jungle, delayed by her repeated falls into the river. Despite the time period, when women were supposed to be modest, Jane doesn't seem to know what underwear is. Yeesh. I can't believe people actually paid to see this tripe.

"Sleep with Me" would be completely worthless if not for a Quentin Tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of "Top Gun."  That lasts about two minutes.  The remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious, ersatz neo-Bohemian characters. Except for Tarantino's "Top Gun" bit (and the twenty seconds or so when Parker Posey has her shirt off) there's nothing worthwhile here

I seriously did not laugh once in this movie.  Horatio Sanz got me to crack a smile a couple times, but I can't believe I think he should have been in the movie more.  I thought Saturday Night Live was bad, I had no idea!  SNL is gold compared to this.  Every single joke falls flat and the director obviously has no clue how to make a movie.  I can't even tell if Jerry O'Connel and Jake Busey are bad actors because the director doesn't even give them a chance.  I think one thing that could have really helped this movie out would have been a script.  In case the director reads this review I want to tell him you need to have a script BEFORE shooting a film.  Just a tip.

Not erotic, sexy (? was that actress really a woman?, was her boyfriend really a man? or visa/versa) Damned if I could tell.  And that old man who tired her up, ya think he had enough rope? The movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through.  French people are not pretty, and this woman was not only NOT pretty, but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma.  Even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog.  Save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience

I thought, since this was a Criterion Collection flick, that it was gonna be a psychedelic, spaced-out trip through India with heavy Ravi Shankar music, incense, and flower children with bells and long hair trying to "find themselves". It was about as far away from that as anyone could get, but it was WEIRD nonetheless. Basically, it's the story of a bunch of rich white people living in India on some sort of plantation, far from the everyday realities of India itself in their luxurious palace. When I found out the plot I was immediately turned off, because I hate movies about rich white people, especially when they slum around in foreign countries ripping off the local economy through some sort of corporate pseudo-slave labor arrangement, sitting back on their plantations acting all sophisticated in white linen clothing.

This has got to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The characters are pointless and one-dimensional. The guy is a jerk and inspires no sympathy. They have sudden fights over apparently nothing. In fact, there is no cause-and-effect in this movie at all! Things just happen randomly for no apparent reason. There's no real story. The takes are boring; most scenes hum along endlessly making for quite boring viewing. The violent ending wasn't even believable! Instead of inspiring any kind of shock or sympathy, I was left just thinking "what the...???" Really, really pointless all around

When I rented Twentynine Palms, I knew it would showcase Bruno Dumont's taste for dispassionate portrayals, violence of various sorts, and shock. In spite of this mental preparation, this very atmospheric film built to a grotesque resolution that left me, a seasoned viewer, rattled. Unfortunately, the shock and awe that the film achieves is short lived. Twentynine Palms is modeled on the horror film, but, like many of its American cousins, the horror it achieves failed to haunt me. The film as a whole left me with an unsettled feeling, as if a cynic had just talked my ear off.  I also had the sense that this was more about the worldview of the director, rather than the world his film creates.

This is the worst movie that was ever made. I'd rather move to Paris and hang out in cafes debating French politics than watch this movie again. It is so bad that it's not worth watching just out of a sense of morbid curiosity-- it is disappointing from every angle. In this case the word bad means world-class egregious waste of otherwise perfectly good blank film. I can't even force myself to describe the movie, it's not worth the effort. I don't like thinking about the movie as I write this. What I'm really concerned about are the people here who somehow found any kind of entertainment value from this movie. Are they nuts, or just the products of our modern, mindless universities? Someone needs to tell them it's time for their medicine and to stay off the Internet

A totally awesome movie when it was first released, Hawaii is based on the James A. Michener bestseller. Even at three hours plus, it still had to leave a lot of Michener's novel untouched, but the basic idea is still there. The breathtaking cinematography adds to it, as does an outstanding Elmer Bernstein score. Then there's the acting by the stars, Max Von Sydow as the missionary who goes to Hawaii to preach to the natives, and brings his own brand of religion with him. Julie Anderws is outstanding in a rare non-singing role as his wife. Richard Harris is excellent as the sea captain who is amazed that the preacher's wife turns out to be an old girlfriend.

Well, I had to succumb.  I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad.  My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded.  This film reaches new cinematic depths.  It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate.  Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever!  I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks.  Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful.  Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.  To get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness I'm going to have to watch an actual good movie, like "Showgirls"

Complete Fiction
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
While there has never been a completely factual account of the life of Wyatt Earp ("Tombstone" comes the closest), this film is completely fictional. First, Wyatt isn't even married in this version, and he becomes enamored with a woman named Clementine; thus the title. Doc Holliday was a dentist, but in this film, he is a surgeon who operates on a wounded bargirl he loves.

Dismayingly bad

</title>
<text>
<Text>
It's not just that If lucy Fell is a bad film. 90% of what comes out of Hollywood is uninspired, formulaic dross just like it, and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it. What makes this movie memorably, remarkably bad is writer/director/star Eric Schaeffer's nauseatingly immense sense of self-regard, which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday's roadkill. The mere fact that the photogenically-challenged Mr. Schaeffer should have the likes of Elle MacPherson tell him he's "cute" speaks volumes

Ok, so I am not a big vampire movie fan, so maybe that had something to do with the fact that I thought this movie sucked. But I am always open minded to all sorts of films, so I thought I would give this one a whirl. It started out with some potential, but within the first 20 minutes I knew it was going to be hopeless. I should have just turned the darned thing off. It was so unrealistic (ok, I know it's a vampire movie, so what did I expect) but I just didn't believe that the main character (Kerr) would have done the things he ended up doing thru out the movie. And then the girl (Izabella Miko) who had about 8 lines in the movie; that was just lame and pointless. She must have felt like such a loser telling people, yeah, I'm in this movie "The Forsaken", and I'm in it almost the entire time...but....ahhh....well just call me zombie girl. Anyways, I highly recommend a pass on this one, unless you are a complete vampire fanatic

Three years after the first mortal kombat film, fans couldn't wait for Annihilation to come out. Unfortunately, the sequel did not do well at the box office and after viewing it, I can see why. First, I will start with what is positive about the movie. Kitana had more of a role as did Jax, I preferred Sandra Hess as Sonya a little over Bridget Wilson even though she did a good job with Sonya's character in the first movie, some of the fight scenes (Jax vs. Cyrax, Sonya vs. Mileena, Liu Kang vs. Baraka, Sub-Zero vs. Scorpion) were sequenced good, the dvd bonus features were nice, and the soundtrack was awesome. These positive aspects, however, could not save the overall film from disappointment. So what went wrong? Like the first MK, Annihilation attempted to blend two mortal kombat games into one movie (mortal kombat 3 and ultimate mortal kombat 3). Unlike the first MK, however, the blend was not successful. Too many characters were put into the movie and therefore the character development for most of them was almost non-existent. Aside from that, only three of the actors to my knowledge returned from the previous movie though it is understandable why the other actors did not return. What else went wrong with this sequel? Some of the acting was either over-the-top and/or downright pitiful. Shao Kahn's character along with Raiden's character was poorly resembled. Also, some of the characters didn't even get much screen time at all. One flaw that is immediately noticed at the beginning of the movie is that one of the main characters gets killed off (I won't say who because it is probably obvious). While some of the fight sequences were good, most of them were rushed and some were just flat-out ridiculous. This goes double for the animality sequence. Sadly, MK Annihilation doesn't rank up with the first one. Despite all this, there is some good news. After eight long years of waiting, a third mortal kombat film will hit the big screen with most of the actors returning from the first movie. Plus, the third installment will not only kontinue where the first left off but will also ignore the events of Annihilation

Exploitation Versus Art--Ingmar Bergman's Oscar Winner and Wes Craven's Shocker Tell The Same Tale
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, "Last House on the Left" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation.

I found this movie to be a fascinating story about the trauma that can be caused to those we love when we allow our fantasies and daydreaming to interfere with our actual lives. I was constantly wondering where I would draw the line if I was the heroine. The experience allowed me to visualize the mayhem that could be caused by to much fantasy/daydreaming

Not That Great
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
A number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The plot is disjointed and confusing; jumping from the North African Theatre to the European Theatre almost seamlessly, leaving the viewer thoroughly confused.  The character development is also very poor.  No one character stands out due to the fact that Samuel Fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue.  Historically speaking this film is a joke.  During the action scenes when the Germans have tanks they are in fact American tanks with the German symbol painted on.  Also, uniforms are sometimes inaccurate.  However, the most annoying aspect is the fact that Samuel Fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the ONLY squad fighting the entire war.  Only once or twice do you see any other American troops.  This feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war, of which these men are supposed to be a part of.  Finally, to make matters worse, the film's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical, sloppy, awkwardly placed, and consist of ridiculous situations.

Dreary, hard to watch.

</title>
<text>

Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...

Don't know about anyone else, but the DVD I purchased had lousy video.  The only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots. All of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either. I know the concert was indoors, but I've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem.  Did I get a bad DVD or did anyone else have this problem

Didn't Emanuelle used to involve mostly eroticism?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
If you want erotica then this isn't the Emanuelle film for you.  Yes, there are a couple of so-so love scenes, but the one lesbian scene is pratically non-existent, and the obvious focus of this one is the blood and gore content.  I expected more erotic content, and instead got mostly gruesome scenes that I didn't particularly expect.  Remember that scene in &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; where a nude Bo Derek was tied up and bathed by native women?  That scene was erotic.  Nothing like that one this video

As a frequent visitor to the Himalayas and being closely in touch with both Tibetans (ordinary folks, not the tortured ones) and the Chinese, I find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided. I have not met a single wealthy Tibetan in Nepal or India, who can swear to me that he will return to a freed Tibet, run by their government in exile.

I was aniticpatng a riveting documentary... After reading some books on Tibet, I thought this documentary would be especially enlightening. I found it to be slow paced, repetitive and thin on factual information (factual history and an intelligent logical supportable case for the Tibetan side of the Chinese invasion/occupation) and heavy on "experiences and testimonials" of certain Tibetans. The bit about "the American's abandoned us" was un-necessary and somewhat of a turn off. Not that this man felt abandoned (I have the utmost compassion for his experiences), but rather that the editors of this piece opted to include his comments along side the "evil communist Chinese" bits. Overall, this documentary of the Tibetan experience is too heavy on the emotionally charged (I did cry at one point), too repetitive (frankly, it gets boring), and too thin on (non emotionally charged) information.

I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.

This movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books. Ethan Hawke leans to heavily on Kris Kristofferson's performances not to mention Jeff Tweedy's music. As a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music. It is written interestingly enough, but the visuals look like there wasn't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on. The best way to watch this movie is in the background. You don't need the visuals, and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away

So much of his oeuvre remains hidden from view that each discovery from the archives is greeted with an inordinate amount of enthusiasm.  Take this intriguing yet relatively disappointing collection of documentaries Welles directed for British TV in the 1950s.

I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up.

Not That Great

A number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The plot is disjointed and confusing; jumping from the North African Theatre to the European Theatre almost seamlessly, leaving the viewer thoroughly confused.  The character development is also very poor.  No one character stands out due to the fact that Samuel Fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue.  Historically speaking this film is a joke.  During the action scenes when the Germans have tanks they are in fact American tanks with the German symbol painted on.  Also, uniforms are sometimes inaccurate.  However, the most annoying aspect is the fact that Samuel Fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the ONLY squad fighting the entire war.  Only once or twice do you see any other American troops.  This feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war, of which these men are supposed to be a part of.  Finally, to make matters worse, the film's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical, sloppy, awkwardly placed, and consist of ridiculous situations.

I was a big fan of the ST1. The plot and characters were excellent, it rated up there with the best of them I would give ST1 5 stars. I saw this was on sale for a great price so I got it expecting great things. Usually sequels aren't to par with the originals so I at least expeted a 3-star movie. When i flipped on the movie i said "WOW....right where they left off" at a pretty good battle seen with the BUGS. Well, that was it I was waiting for more action. I waited....I waited...I waited and I waited...they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still wasn't worth it. I don't know who's idea it was for the sequel but I hope this was their last one. I'll stick with the new Battlestar Galactic and Star Trek reruns

I did not like this movie. I know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity. Nonetheless, I found it very disturbing: his lack of concern for his wife and children, how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional, and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have "a bit on the side." And what about her kids? apart from the first scene we never see them again; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man. I'm not a prude, really, but this film left a bad taste in my mouth

THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's.  It pains me to say this for I am a fan of the series.  It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of leadership.  Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic.  Why would a Decepticon warrior follow him into battle?  As for the new generations of Autobots and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.

This movie is my favorite movie. Ever. I feel terrible giving it two stars. But it gets 2 stars because I am comparing it to the Rhino version, which I also own. I also own the original VHS. I have watched this movie at least once a year since I was 8 except for about 6 years in middle school/HS. I can sit in class and watch it from memory in my head.

'Clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor. While hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its pluses.

With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a "blind date" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.

A Dissenting View

As the reviews below indicate, "Arthur" has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 Vincent Canby of the New York Times found it a wonderful "screwball comedy" (although over time, Times readers, perhaps more discerning than Vincent, have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars) and Bravo listed it #10 on its list of Best Comedies (see below). I first saw Dudley Moore in "Foul Play," thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought "10" and "Arthur," as it turned out a downward trajectory.

Easy Come Easy Go should be for boats fans.

<Text>
If you got Elvis Presley and Dodie Marshall and put them in the same film you will have Easy Come Easy Go, an Elvis Presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love. But anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an Elvis Presley fan will be un-happy. And Elvis' leading lady in this film is Dodie Marshall which I guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947. And this is one of final films that Elvis sings the same song with somebody else, and the song is Yoga Is As Yoga Goes. He sings that with Elsa Lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher. If you are an Elvis Presley fan, then buy or rent Jailhouse Rock on video or dvd

Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed. I have nothing more to add to the other reviews posted here; just to agree that the sound was poor and the viewing quite fuzzy. I remember watching not only the first broadcast on NBC but several broadcasts years after that, with different casts. It was and still is my favorite Christmas story. I will certainly purchase the Schippers CD and hope to see another video or DVD in the future

Amahl Revisited
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
It is unfortunate that the only video presentation of Amahl is so generously flawed in stagecraft and sound production. It is not necessary to enumerate specifics here since some were cited in Ms. Lynch's review. True, Ms. Stratas' voice was often subjugated by the orchestra, but there were also  moments when her diction was less than perfect, during times which the orchestra had, gratefully, been relegated to a less prominent decibel level.  Here, sound production staff  must share blame.  Menotti knew what he was writing. A brilliant orchestrator, he etched clearly, the differences between orchestral dialogue and accompaniment figures. Staging, at times, appears to have little to do with the music. When one thinks of Menotti and opera (almost synonymous), the marriage of music AND theatre is considered a perfect union. Sadly, Menotti's obvious musical intentions were overlooked. It is heartening to read that a new video of this opera may be produced. I would disagree with Ms. Lynch that it is a good introduction to this operatic work. The beginning, the introduction makes the strongest impression.  It is lasting.  This is one indelibility I would not welcome

Okay, Ginger Snaps one has become one of my all time favorite horror films. I loved the first one,but I dont understand how people can say the sequel is just as good as the first. I had some problems with this movie. First, there were some plot holes actually there was alot of plot holes (who the hell was the wolf chasing her? Was it Sam from the first Ginger Snaps?). But my biggest problem was, im not even sure.It was boring and not that interesting.We dont even get to see Bridgette cause mayhem as a wolf.Ghost is really annoying to watch in the film and well i just didnt like this one. I dont understand what people loved aboput this film.The only thing that kept me interested was the fact that its Bridgett and actually Ginger Snaps.I love the sisters characters.But this film just wasnt all that good at all. I still yet have to watch "The Beginning",and since its much more expensive hopefully its better

Worthless Western
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Claim purports to be an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's classic novel, The Mayor of Casterbridge transplanted to the Old West. The producers clearly wanted The Claim to be accepted as a literate Western and it is clear that the critics fell for it. However, as anyone who has read the original Hardy novel can tell you, the movie fails as a Hardy adaptation. Meanwhile, any fan of movie westerns can tell you that The Claim is a failure in that department as well.

Shark(from some other footage) Attack
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Shark Attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage.  The movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver.  The most interesting part is all the shark footage...  The best scene is after the bad guy/hotel owner is eaten, the shark clearly shown with a hook in it's mouth being pulled towards a boat.  This of course has nothing at all to do with the plot.  So where did this hook come from?  It was probably I was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie

One beautifully filmed butchered mess of a movie!!!!!!!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
If I was asked to give you a plot synopsis of this gorgeous film I would be hard pressed to say that OSCAR AND LUCINDA is about  anything for sure.This is positively the singlemost butchered screenplay I have ever sat through.Laura Jones has adapted Peter Carey's novel and Gillian Armstrong has turned out "something" that is so chopped up and nonsensical that, apart from from the very quick shots of New South Wales and a magnificent soundtrack by Thomas Newman,  I had to keep pausing the film to say,"WHAT???!!!" This film is about everything and it is about nothing;it is about obsession and compulsion;it is about different religions;it is about chance and faith;it is about a father and son;it is about how a grandson came to be.........but it certainly IS NOT about two connected characters named Oscar and Lucinda.Each scene of this film is SO short and abrupt that the viewer never has any time to identify/sympathize/empathize with ANY of these extremely disconnected people and events.There are SO many plots and subplots and themes and subthemes and non essential material and characters that it is positively laughable and annoying to see such squander of good source material in the wrong ,uncapable and un-understanding hands.It seems that trying to tell any of the heart and soul that is revealed in Peter Carey's novel in slightly more than two hours proved to be too much for those involved in this endeavour.What a shock to see the immense talents of A -list actors such as Ralph Fiennes,Cate Blanchett,Ciaran Hinds and Tom Wilkinson literally wasted in 20 second scenes!Even the breathtaking land of the Australian outback is shown for five seconds at the most.AND THE ENDING!!!!!.....what in Heaven's name was that???Either most of this film is still on the cutting room floor( edited by the noferious Nicholas Beauman of LITTLE WOMEN,COUNTRY LIFE,COSI) or Laura Jones and Gillian Armstrong just simply could not find any center and focus for this beautifully filmed "butchered" mess of a movie.2*'s because the Thomas Newman soundtrack is so lovely,but nay a farthing more!!

Comparing Oceans 11 of the 1960s to the remakes of today is like comparing the Vegas casinos of yesteryear and today.  The hippest casinos of that era were, by today's highest standards of casino elegance and class (no, I'm not talking about Excalibur), dull, smokey, hokey, and cramped - just like the original Oceans 11.

Poor HD-DVD
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I own both Blu-ray and HD-DVD movies, and have been consistently dissapointed with all the HD-DVD's.  They just don't compare to Blu-ray.  The Hulk was not a very good movie to begin with, and the transer to HD-DVD was not impressive.  Picture quality was average at best, and the sound quality was also mediocre.  I have yet to find any HD-DVD that is even comparable to the best of Blu-ray

I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.

The thousand injuries of Fortunado
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
First, this piece of trash is based on The Journey To The West about as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on the Bible. There are some characters common to both Lost Empire and Journey. Well, common in name. That said let's get to the real problem with this film. It is astoundingly insulting to Chinese religious traditions. Imagine for a moment some non-Christian producing a film in which: the God Jehova no longer cares what happens to humanity and just gives us over to Satan; Jesus gives up on that sacrifice stuff and is now focused purely on the personal acquisition of wealth and power; and the Virgin Mary comes to earth for a hot night at the singles bars. Sound offensive? It is. And this film is equally insulting to Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism (the three big ones in China).

Cheeze-Corn...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...

I was not thrilled with this work.  Here's why:  The movie jumps about in non-logical fashion that distracts from the flow.  It is beautifully filmed with great costumes, colors, imagery but the acting is so bland, almost weak!  Christ, I wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate! The sex scenes were boring.  Maybe i should make films!  This is frustrating!!

How much did they spend on this garbage? Worst  Levinson film I've seen since  "Envy"
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I actually wish they had given us director commentary on this disc because I would have listened to a little of it just to see what Barry Levinson was thimking and I would cross my fingers and hope he would blame the whole thing on a really bad drug trip. Take a look at the man's filmography and tell me if you think this absolute disgrace belongs there. Worse, he wasn't alone, SOMEONE ELSE liked the idea enough to co-write it. Everyone else can blame a large paycheck, but Levinson actually came up with the idea. This is one of the most beautiful terrible films I ever seen, if they took one tenth of the imagination they put into the set and toy designs and invested it into the screenplay they might have had a movie

Almost unwatchable sci-fi turkey
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This blatently derivative (hat tip to Ridley Scott's Alien, with a hint of Stanley Donen's Saturn 3 thrown in) movie should surely win the award for the most irritatingly gratuitous over-use of strobe lighting ever. This makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch and is, presumably, employed to detract from the lack of any genuine thrills. Throw in a ridiculously precocious ship's computer and a downright silly robot, and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space. James Spader and Angela Bassett do their best to make something out of an inadequate script and plot, but this is unremittingly dreadful and dull.  The &quot;happy ever after&quot; finale will probably make you cringe in its corniness. Supernova's only redeeming factor is that it is very short

This movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold.  Martin does a great job with Nick Nolte as an artist in "life lessons" and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching Ford Coppolas somthing Zoe i began to tire and by the end of Woody Allens snoozefest i was bored stiff.  My advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off.  The first 30 minutes is GREAT film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film.

I did not like this movie. I know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity. Nonetheless, I found it very disturbing: his lack of concern for his wife and children, how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional, and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have "a bit on the side." And what about her kids? apart from the first scene we never see them again; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man. I'm not a prude, really, but this film left a bad taste in my mouth

"slice of life"?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I've seen the phrase "slice of life" used many times to describe this movie, which makes me wonder - whose life is this a slice of? Certainly not mine, and not most people's. The Anniversary Party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain, self-absorbed, jaded and rich beyond most people's wildest fits of imagination. Worse, there isn't much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people, or at least most people who are fun to be around, don't act the way these characters do.

THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's.  It pains me to say this for I am a fan of the series.  It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of leadership.  Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic.  Why would a Decepticon warrior follow him into battle?  As for the new generations of Autobots and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.

FINE HISTORIC RENDITION
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Filmed in 1933, this movie is in black and white, and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today's standards.  An accurate chronology of the six wives of Henry VIII, the characters of the wives are rather  undeveloped, and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important  religious and political questions around which the marriages centered.  A  good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story, but  the serious scholar will want to conduct further research

Survivor Rip Off
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show

The film shows no action, except a disgusting performance of cutting apart a dead body, and you ask yourself, in what relation to the subject of the film this stands. (Sorry, forgot the 3-second-sceen of a naked young man) Just the head of 17-year-old lads, who wonder why they got infected, when they work as prostitute,  explaning in detail what they are to do in this job and where you can find them in Prag. (Like advertising) You are provided with not the least background information about their education, why they left their home town, why they have no normal job. I would wonder what politics think and do  about the youth in the new EC-country, what young people get told about the danger of deceases at school, and what other chances they have in life

A great film given the basest possible DVD treatment from Fox Lorber
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Most of those who were lucky enough to see this stunning Srdjan Dragojevic film at select film festivals in the U.S. have not forgotten its clarity, its anger, and its power.  The movie was passed up for theatrical distribution, although it was readily available on VHS and now on DVD from Fox Lorber.

Post - war propaganda
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This film was probably made not to entertain the audience, but more to show as much as possible the reality of the terrible agresion on Bosnia. But it does so for a small part only, showing the Bosniaks and Serbs living together peacefuly before the agresion. With the begin of hostilities this film leaves its half-folkloral nature and becomes a pure propaganda movie of serbian nationalists. Its attempt to blind the viewer, hoping he never watchs news or read a newspaper, is amaturelike and fails not only through its fake of reality, but also through poor cinematografic form. The dialogs are poor and the actors definitely not worth the theme of the movie. Handfull of interesting phrases and few fleshes of situation are by far not enough to save the movie from the abyss. The handling shows several onlogical moments. And as a concept of &quot;we all suffered and we Serbs did not start the war&quot; it only makes a serious and average informed viewer laughing. This movie does not entertain at all, and shows the events as unrealistic as any B - movie about Vietnamwar. And about facts it shows only that there are very unserious and nationalistic directors and producers in Serbia. My rating is absolutely thumb down. Comparing with, for example, No Man's Land this motion picture is failing in everything that makes movies about war a potential time window about occurences in former Yugoslavia. Instead to jump into the minds of people that participated the war, You can only get an idea of dogma that the director is trying to spread by making this underaverage movie

Could be such a great movie...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
...but, sadly, falls way short.  They have a great storyline with a twisted triangle and intense power struggles but the filming is so choppy that one scene ends and the next begins, sometimes with no connection.  The scenes do not blend into each other, forming a movie that is pleasant to watch.  This movie jumps from one place to another that seems to contradict but with no explanation of the change.  One scene the main girl is wildly in love with her husband, is forgiving of the king's adulterous intentions and is supremely happy.  Shortly thereafter, she wants revenge on every person she's ever met. Yes, she was betrayed, in a way, but not by EVERYone.  The only real high point of the movie is Timothy Dalton, who is a great actor, but this was a lousy setting for his talent.  Also, considering the plot of the movie, there were no intimate scenes.  The only thing that happens in the bedroom is the king beats the girl and he nurses her back from smallpox.  All in all, this story had great potential that was sadly wasted in this movie

Night Life song Replaced

The most memorable part of this film was the dance scene to "Night Life" which would repeat through the movie.  This version credits the song, but it was replaced with some lame disco music. I am writing MGM to complain and demand a refund.  Even the trailer has the right music playing all through it.

I saw the show on stage.  I saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this.  Unfortunately, this is Ann Reinking's version of Bob Fosse.  Reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential Fosse dancer of the 70's and 80's created this tribute.  The difference is Ann Reinking has taken the Fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own.

Watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled. Boring and tacky even by horror standards, the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids' future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet, hence the title. I've seen far worse, but those worse movies were more &quot;enjoyable&quot; than this. The following morning you probably won't remember having seen it. If only the monster had eaten this movie's negative, then we would all be spared

An average movie with average performances. Glosses over many of the details in the book and ignores the role of many important characters. It wont appeal much to the general audience and neither will it satisfy the people who have already read the book.

The creator of M*A*S*H wrote this?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I was surprised to see Larry Gelbart wrote the screenplay of this unfunny movie.  I can recall very few laughs in this film.  The premise of the film is to highlight the greed of the 1980's, but the lesson is quite dated in the era of Enron and WorldCom.  The greed here is apparent and at least honest and upfront, in contrast to the dishonesty and deception of some of the greed of the late 1990's.  As for the message, I certainly don't think the shareholders of RJR Reynolds minded being courted so well.  If I were a shareholder of a slumping company I'd be mighty grateful to live in a society where people have the freedom to pay whatever crazy price they want for my stock!  James Garner is wonderful in this show, and the movie does a nice job of laying out the business concepts in terms your grandmother can understand.  I do have to confess, however, to dozing a bit in the middle of this movie, so perhaps I missed the funny parts

An accessible story with all the elements of a Great American Novel was somehow transformed into a perverse, worst of the worst ABC Afterschool Specials. If you had not read the book, you would be unable to follow what was happening. Some of the worst directing and editing I have seen in a long time. The original Evil Dead, with all its flaws, is a better put together film than this one. This movie is flat-out painful to watch. You get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do. It all seems so random. Read the book. If you see this movie in a rental store, just move along, please, nothing to see here

Widely acknowledged classic, I hated it

</title>
<text>
<Text>
The movie is widely considered a classic for Hong Kong action movies.   Leslie Cheung is a fantastic actor, and I enjoyed Bridgitte Lin very much in Chungking Express.  So, even though I don't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies, I still decided to watch this movie.  I was extremely disappointed.  The cinematography is boring and poorly done.  The plot is juvenile.  It is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys.  I hated the movie.  However, I fully understand that many, many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important HK movies ever made.

So this movie is made of 2 stories.  The first one is quick and involves Takeshi Kaneshiro and Brigitte Lin.  Both have their stories and I actually found Kaneshiro more interesting.  So this thing ends and the movie should have also.  It should have been a 30 minute movie.  So for the next hour or so we get to watch Tony Leung Chiu Wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs.  Wow, what a movie.  The only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day.  She was fun to watch but I still wish I wouldn't have seen this dumb movie.

A contrary opinion

Everybody I know loves this film. In today's environment, when WKW is being hailed as the premier director from Asia, and one of the world's best, I don't know how many really actually love the film, and how many don't have the courage to state a contrary opinion. Make no mistake, I think WKW is one of the greatest directors I have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like "In The Mood For Love" (ITMFL) not be? Actually, his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like ITMFL, but in his versatility. It is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both ITMFL and Chungking. Well, his greatness notwithstanding, I can't stand this film. And no, I can't sit, lie, or do anything else with it either.

<Text>
Shark Attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage.  The movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver.  The most interesting part is all the shark footage...  The best scene is after the bad guy/hotel owner is eaten, the shark clearly shown with a hook in it's mouth being pulled towards a boat.  This of course has nothing at all to do with the plot.  So where did this hook come from?  It was probably I was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie

Don't waste your time or money with this DVD.  The best part of the DVD is probably the Trailers and most of those are Garbage also.  My DVD came loose in the package and scratched, too bad it didn't do any damage to ruin the Movie.  I couldn't wait until the Movie was over, I would have stopped it earlier, but wanted to see if any damage was done.  You'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier.  The last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off.  Don't waste your money, spend it on the cheap $5-6 horror DVD's, because at least those can be somewhat entertaining

To put it succinctly, Brendan Fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis, which is then swiped by Joe Pesci, the homeless dude who, predictably, is really quite wise.  The problem is that his "wise" sayings aren't really too wise; he's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent, but doesn't really know that much. Joe Pesci's character is pretty annoying.  That's probably why he ended up friends with Brendan Fraser's character

My Own Personal Hell
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is the first time I delved into the HellRaiser series, and I have to admit, I kind of regret it. The film opens with a collage of disturbing images, I guess to get my attention, but there is no real reason for them to be there. From there the film falls into a freefall where it jumps from one messed up scene to the next. It all looks perfectly twisted, but who really cares. Clive Barker, as he did in "Night Breed," shows his taste for creative costumes and set designs. Of course they are all very self-indulgent, but beautiful nonetheless in their own little way. Had this film showed up at a modern art museum I would have labeled it pretentious. But since it showed up in movie theaters I have no choice but to label it crap.

Ok so I have always thought Courteney Cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it. It really is the most boring show Ive seen in a long time. If you thought she was bad in scream...and friends..dont watch this...there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it. Hopefully this show will be scraped

Read the book instead
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
"The World According to Garp" is on my top 5 list of favorite books of all time.  It's one of those rare books that makes you laugh out loud, but still really feel the emotion of the characters, and the story really sticks with you.  (I made a joke about an Ellen Jamesian just the other day, lol ~ yes, it was a dumb joke that no one else got, but, that's how it goes sometimes :)  I was introduced to the book in college, well after the book and the movie were released, but I had never heard of either one.  I read the book in just a couple of days ~ I couldn't put it down, and I chatted it up with everyone who would listen.  I've re-read it several times since then, and i still think it's terrific.  Naturally, when i found out there was already a movie . . . I was thrilled!  I ordered it right away . . . but i wish i'd never wasted my money.  On it's own, the movie might be alirght.  But when you're invested in the book, when you know the characters, Robin Williams just isn't Garp.  I love Robin Williams, he's a great comedian, that's not a question.  I just think that the casting for this part was way off base.  and if you can't believe the main character, the rest of it's crap.   If you've never read the book, I highly recommend it!!

Just Another Pitiful, Tired Retread
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
After watching this lame, stupid sequel all I can say is "Leave it alone already!" God this film sucked. First, after 25 years of trying to escape from brother Michael, this is how Laurie Strode goes out???!!! Major let down, it should have been more shocking and spectacular. Second, while "20 Years Later/Halloween 7" was made for Lifetime, this one seems to have been made for MTV. All Dimension films has done for this franchise since taking it over for Part 6, is give it style, no substance whatsoever. The only one of their 3 sequels that was remotely scary was 6, fully due to bringing back the guy who played Michael in 4(the last good Halloween film)George Wilbur, he's sorely missed but probably too old for the part now. Third, I'm so sick of rappers and models thinking they can act as is the case in this film with Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks. No talent Busta needs to stick to cursing and throwing his hands around to a repetitive beat and Tyra needs to stick to walking a catwalk in some designer dress with her mouth shut. They suck. Hopefully Hollywood feels the same way since I haven't seen them in anything since, thank god. Fourth, the story is just another retread with a new gimmick, the internet web cam. Poorly executed, no suspense at all in this film. The film was originally suppossed to be released for Halloween '01, but they had to do reshoots to improve the film, unsuccessfully I might add, so it was released in summer '02. Funny, this film was directed by the same guy who directed "Halloween II"(the best sequel). Even funnier is the fact that they had to do reshoots for that one as well, but John Carpenter did them and it DID improve the film. His touch is sorely missed here.

One of my least favorite episodes...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Look...to be fair, one man's BOTE is another man's &quot;Manos&quot;. What I mean by that is some people may love this ep, but I personally didn't find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub-average riffing doesn't save it. The best lines that Mike &amp; the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says. Unfortunately, the feature's horrible pacing, slow dialogue scenes, and atrocious acting are not enough, and it seems like the writers took a break on this one. Of course, even weak MST3K is better than pretty much any other show, but I must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a Season 1 episode (the riffing is sparse and not really funny). If you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it's best, get either &quot;Manos: Hands of Fate&quot; or &quot;Red Zone Cuba&quot;

As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences

Oh PLEASE - whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 Masterpiece Theater TV series of 'Cousin Bette' do so and make it available on DVD.   This was one of THE finest shows ever created for television.  Truly, it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now, 40+ years later, I fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to DVD.  For the sake of one of the theater (and humanity's) most glorious theatrical efforts, PLEASE make the original TV version available!  (BTW - I rate the ORIGINAL item at 5+ STARS!

Politics and Patriotism aside.....this was a trite, cliche-ridden waste of time
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I think a lot of the high scores given to this movie were based on emotion and patriotism. However, judged purely on its cinematic merits, this movie is simply not very good. The premise is excellent, and if properly executed, the movie could have been superb, but it rapidly turns into an endless barrage of cartoonish cliches that have all been done countless times (and better) in movies like the Dirty Dozen.

He did very little talking talking in this movie, he just acted, his best performance ever.  the movie deals with the american indian also, in a profound and touching way.  this movie is engrossing and based on a true story,  it's simply the best. Don't miss the opportunity to see this movie, it is a classic.  It truly is in a league of it's own.

Richard Pryor is my all-time favorite stand-up comedian.  I consider him the best in the business.  But his performance in  &quot;Live and Smokin&quot; shows he's still just a rookie.  He's nervous in front of the camera, and says so several times. His material   is typically raunchy, but not very funny. You can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience. Buy this tape only if you're a die-hard Pryor fan, but don't expect the side-splitting laughter you'll get from &quot;In Concert&quot;, &quot;Live on the Sunset Strip&quot;, and &quot;Here and Now&quot;

I watched this movie, seeing that it was a "shark" movie. But where's the shark?? The plot is these people are hostages. The shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie. But I was watching going, "okay, they're in the water, where is the shark???" Even JAWS 3, (which sucked) has more sharks. If you like hoatage movies, see this. (on second thought, don't...) But if you like sharks, see something else

As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it.  I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this.  What a waste!"  Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes.  The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story.  Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic.  I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening.

A Flawed Experiment
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The extreme reviews here are very misleading; people either say it's the worst film ever made or Godard's best film. Don't believe either camp. If you're not an expert on Godard and/or 1960s avant-garde cinema, I could definitely see a person writing off this movie as "sheer pretentious crap", but that opinion would derive from a mixture of shock and ignorance. On the other hand, those who say this is Godard's finest work must be riding high on acid and Marxism themselves. The truth of the matter is that "Weekend", like every one of Godard's post-Anna Karina films, is more a flawed experiment than anything else: On occasion, interesting and thought-provoking, but more often static and didactic to the point of alienating the viewer rather than converting them. I respect Godard's attempt to create a new cinema built on "ideas" rather than "emotion", but in my opinion, he went too far in this direction. A piece of art devoid of any emotion is a hollow experience and don't we have enough of that in our crude, consumerist society? And as far as experiments go, much of what he was doing in "Weekend", he had already done and with vastly better results in  "Pierrot le Fou". That film was a perfect balance between Godard the political-scientist and Godard the post-modern film-maker. Plus, "Pierrot le Fou" benefited by having Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina. They brought heart and humor to Godard's abstract explosion of ideas; a perfect symbiotic relationship between director and actor(s) that he never achieved again. "Weekend" starts off very promising with the sex dialogue and the long tracking shot of the traffic-jam, leading to a car-crash...but then it descends into a grating mess of dated ideology and too much dead space. You really wish Belmondo and Karina would pop in and show the cast they don't have to be mere nails to Godard's hammer.

Very Irreverant remake of a Disney Icon
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am appalled at the greed that Disney must have to milk out a classic like "The Absent Minded Professer". I found this to be one of the worst if not the worst remake of any movie. I found the plot to be too embelished as it made for the relationship between the characters played by Robin Williams and Marsha Gay-Hayden to be one of where it either tried to remake the safe and easy happy ending that's throughout all Disney movies, or it showed to be one where the parties had to wear their hearts out on their sleeves. I also feel that with the Character of "Flubber" it was a waste of time considering I don't remember any merchandising from the character. They should've stayed with the bouncing rubber balls from the original. I also feel that with the promotion of the Flubber substance that it was all shallow, and commericial as where in the original it was going to be put to good use in the military, and here it was to make a buck. I feel that there are some movies that are best to just be left in original state, and not be remade, and this is one of them.

I thought I'd be nice in giving film two stars even though it pretty much deserves none at all. I wasn't old enough at the time, but I'm sure fans were slightly bemused at the re-emergence of Friday the 13th.  Tommy, now a teenager (and a bloody old one at that) is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of Jason and also the death of his mother.  Tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that Jason is back from the dead.  And it seems he may be right, when a series of murders begins. But who could it possibly be THIS time. Jason is dead, isn't he?

You talk about disappointed, this is the icing on the cake.  All I hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was.  Not even close.  Whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong.  I love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such. There are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the 70's, but this is not one of them....seriously, don't buy this.  I don't know why it is so highly regarded.  The acting, story, and especially the music is EL TERRIBLE'.  It's like porn quality acting, a story written in about 25 minutes and music from a Disney movie.  It could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy, through in some disturbing music, and made the bad guys, well, more bad.  It could be remade (which i'm usually against)

This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.  I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies.

The dynamic Root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children's comedy.  My advice to Root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash.  The only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of the child Curtis.  Big props to my man for his preformance.  Hope to see you in more movies to come.

Another tired story about the Blackman as the horrible villian and the Blackwoman as the innocent victim...And we wonder why our community has so many problems..Maybe it's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films..."Color Purple" , "For Colored Girls...." etc. We need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we "work together"...That means Blackmen and Blackwomen..

I thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular.  It kept me awake but just on the verge.  The few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie.  I thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best. Overall I was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star.

This is the worst holiday movie in America! I mean if you buy this product you'll face torture (as in singing horribly.) Making friends as the movie says is not the most important thing in the world in my belief. They also said that "If you want, wish for fairy tales and it will come true." Right. Some fairy tales are gruesome (for example this one fairy tale is so gruesome because it has fairies heads cut off.) Eeww! The voice talents are very annoying. Better save your money when you buy a christmas movie

I like films that push things to the edge and address taboos, so I was looking forward to this exploration of kink, sadomasochism and Nazism, written and directed both by women.  --Hey, it sure promised to be original.  You can't say "Oh, not *another* movie about a female concentration camp prisoner who grows fond of her tormentor and wants to continue their sadomasochistic relationship a decade later."

I might have enjoyed this movie more if they hadn't gutted the book, which was a pretty good read. The best character in the book, FBI Special Agent Pendergast, isn't even in the movie, and New York City police Lt. D'Agosta is just a comic caricature of the book's character.

This is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic.  I hadn't read the book before seeing the movie.  The film stunk.  A few years later, I read the book and was enchanted.  I did not make the connection that this was the same story until I saw the film again on late night tv.  I was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen.  Then, I realized what movie it was.  I tried to sit through it.  I just couldn't.  The monster should have eaten the film

Dario Argento's "Tenebre" is more of a murder mystery with graphic violence rather than a pure horror movie.  This is not a knock on "Tenebre", but having purchased this movie because it was characterized as a "horror movie", I was a bit disappointed overall.

This is not a good Tornado disaster movie by any stretch of the imagination. The worse thing about the film is the horrible, unconvincing special-effects! The scene where the family in the car trying to outrun the tornado in the town and the mom shrieking &quot;It's coming closer!&quot; is badly done and also Dan starting to fly out the window and his dad attaining super-human strength pulling him back into the vehicle is incredibly stupid and not dramatic in the slightest. I know, however, a guy named Mike and 2 robots who would probably have to endure this terrible B-grade movie (Actually F-grade) If you want a good, entertaining tornado movie that doesn't include bad acting, bad &quot;Special&quot; FX, bad script and dumb actors check out &quot;Twister&quot

I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved.  I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse.

I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse

Quaint Comedy Could Have Been Better
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Most L &amp; H fans know that the boys made a long series of MGM/FOX pictures which reflected the big studio &quot;assembly line&quot; film-making approach and the wartime atmosphere. Students of film comedy  understand how the &quot;traditional&quot; Stan &amp; Ollie would be  somewhat suppressed in that regard. However, it's very sad to watch a  decent premise with great performers go COMPLETELY to waste, as it does in  AAW - the presence of Edgar Kennedy should lift th proceedings; instead it  reinforces the melancholia. I found the drunken scene most distasteful.  Still, L &amp; H followers might want to place it somewhere on their video  carousel for an occasional peep into what could have been

Not Really An Apt Title

<Text>
I remember managing to find a drive-in that was showing the first run ECEG; and I remember my girlfriend not saying a word while we watched. She was too kind. In retrospect, it was so totally wrong for the time that one almost has to respect it. I say almost. It was a numbing experience then and the most one can say for it now is: At least the Elvis impersonators will leave it alone. The story is weak, the co-stars are painful, and the soundtrack so bad, the weakest selling record of Elvis' career managed to kill of the Extended Playing record. But , for all that, it is Elvis, and the true beliver will find something in it worth carrying away. Its just best watched alone.

I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service

It's amazing that this much acting talent could be shoe-horned into such a bad movie.  I don't see how it could have yielded six 5-star reviews (The Godfather it ain't).

Hands down the worst of the series (that has to do with Michael).
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Yup, definately the worst Halloween movie. Come on, Michael on a reality show? Ha! What the f**k does that have to do with the series? Not only that, but the plot is completely pointless, the acting sucks, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie! Not only that, but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary, and therefore comes off as pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE gore in movies, horror or not, but any knowledgable Halloween fan knows that the Halloween movies were always scary without the gore. Along with Halloween 3 (which actually had nothing to do with Michael), Halloween: Resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series. There are a many more problems with the movie than the ones I listed, but I'm tired of typing, so I'll let other reviewers explain why it's so bad. Bottom line, watch ANY Halloween movie other than this or Halloween 3

I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show

This movie is the most frightening film I've tried to watch with my [...] daughter. It is NOT suitable for very young children. I was rather horrified by just how creepy it is. The juxtaposition of the saccharine bears with the sadistic cruel scary "spirit" is truly bizarre and could;ve been created by someone who in fact HATES children. If you are not buying this movie due to your own nostalgic desire to relive the 80's, but to watch something sweet and cuddly with your sweet and cuddly children, be forewarned. This movie is not only bad, it's kinda 'bad'. Like, not in a good way. If children are not involved in the purchase- but you are reliving the 80's or getting some really weird gift for a friend, then, you know, maybe you'll dig it. I didn't

The day that they come out with all ten seasons on DVD I will buy them all and really wish I could now!  I just bought the pilot episode on DVD and am hoping that this will sell well and that they'll go on to put all the seasons on DVD already.  I know there is still a huge worldwide fan base who would purchse them!!

Do not waste your time or money, see the original. Once in awhile, a remake of a movie from another culture works; for example, Seven Samurai becomes "Magnificant Seven" -- Most of the time, the remake is trash. The original "La Femme Nikita" is a great movie: exciting with a strong political viewpoint; this version is simply Hollywood pablum

Great Stars, Good Idea, Mediocre Execution
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
A comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of Heaven (Fanny Ardant, Victoria Abril) and Hell (Gael Garcia Bernal, Penelope Cruz) battling over the soul of a Mexican boxer is promising, but this attempt at satire, full of symbolism (Hell is represented by English-speaking executives, for example), is clumsily executed, only rarely amusing, and the superb Fanny Ardant is not given anything to do.  What a waste! You'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors.

I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending.

The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle.

Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them

Harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals, and her bright friend's big plan is to set off a smoke bomb (incendiary) during a school assembly. Either one will get a kid expelled, arrested, and in the newspapers. Not amusing ! Then there's Golly telling her about the virtues of lying. If there is a lesson that could be drawn (which the movie misses), Harriet's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing, because she is showing the sort of behavior that (in a kid 2 years older) would be take as a possible symptoms for other bad things like self-mutilation or bulemia, as in the movie "Thirteen.

</Text>
</title>

<Text>
Quick... what's not in widescreen and has no special features?  That's right - MEGALODON!  SIXTY FEET OF PREHISTORIC TERROR - or so claims the box art.  This film may be about a shark, but the production is all about FRANKENSTEIN.  Seen JAWS?  How about THE ABYSS, ALIEN, REPTILICUS, DEEP BLUE SEA, DEEP STAR SIX or LEVIATHAN?  Then you've seen most, if not all, of MEGALODON.  It's all here - the high tech multi-billion dollar drill site, a small, but the "best at what they do" crew, the ill timed major storm (snow and ice), an ill crewman, a lost world filled with lost fish stuffed with lost Magalodons, the standard crew roundtable scar sharing scene, a spunky blond girl reporter and her husky semi-comic cameraman.  Tiny one man (one woman) subs, a helicopter crash, several "tragic" deaths all capped off with a whiz-bang explosion at the end which solves most (but not all) of the problems.  MEGALODON takes no chances by leaving nothing to the imagination.  It simply takes no risks - which is odd since it tries so hard to move in another direction all the time.  There's a good story here blocked by a very large shark.  The Magalodon doesn't come into view until halfway through the film and up until then you may find yourself wondering when they're just going to get on with it - but once the shark does arrive, does get into frame - you begin to realize that there was something more building here.

Good special effects for that time period.  Served its purpose to boost the morale of the American public during 1943.  The heroic acts by those in the U.S. military at that time should always be remembered.  Outgunned and outmanned they held their own, and then some on Wake Island and in the Philippines.

Since this is one of my top four all-time favorite films and I love films passionately, I am ABSOLUTELY beside myself in fury and anger at the HORRIBLE packaging on this magnificent film. I could forgive the lack of extras. I know A LOT of people working for these international movie conglomerates don't give a damn about the Classics (or even movies in general, really). But the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great, PERFECT, scene-by-scene-, shot-by-shot, movie is STAGGERING. Not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images, not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring... they picture the villianess, not the heroine, with the hero ! Where is the original poster art !!!!! THe insert art !!! The half sheet art !!! The reissue art !!! There . isnt . even . a . booklet . . or . flyer . inside . NOTHING ! This looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff . Columbia Pictures.. I am shouting . At . YOU

Jane Fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful, if opinonated (remember Hanoi Jane?), woman.  I watched this as a teenager and despite the "striptease" this has to be one of her worst.  Hormones be damned, watching this was a waste of time.  If you like Fonda, try Klute.  She was an excellent actress --- but no one could survive this mess.

As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences

There are so many reviews saying this is a true story I have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real (obviously), about everything else is dramatized (including the mission objectives: SCUD hunting on foot, which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today). McNab has essentially written Tom Clancy genre fiction. The book Bravo Two Zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol, Chris Ryan, called The One That Got Away. However, both are convincingly debunked by a third SAS memeber in a book called The Real Bravo Two Zero, also available on Amazon, though only the UK Amazon site (which you can still order from in the US). In it, an SAS member who can actually speak Arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people McNab and Ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story. Most importantly, he manages to restore, without a doubt, the reputation of Vince Phillips, blamed by Ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the Iraqis and a couple members eventually killed. Contrary to what you may expect, I would recommend seeing this, in fact I recommend getting and comparing all three books: B20, The One That Got Away, and The Real B20

And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO

As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found "Altered States", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of "hack movie making". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity

This Film is a Disaster
</Text>

Tom Berenger must have been desperate for work when he signed up for this embarrassment of a film.  It has the feel and tone of  the kind of made for television movie you might watch out of sheer boredom and exhaustion on a Sunday afternoon when you're too tired either to locate the remote or to fire a bullet at the television screen.  The acting is wooden and unnatural, and the music, which is supposed to be awesome, sounds curiously like a bad rip-off of Springsteen, even though the flashbacks in the film (when most of the musical scenes occur) are set, for the most part, in 1963, when NOTHING sounded like Springsteen.  Worse yet, the sets do not look like 1963.  This is very clearly a cheap production, doomed from the start by an awful script, terrible acting, and a devil may care attitude about capturing the feeling of an era.  Here's the premise of the film: years after Eddie, the tempestuous and dumb lead singer of the Cruisers, has disappeared (he died in a car accident, but his body was never recovered), a reporter decides to write a story about the band.  She has a theory that Eddie is still alive and believes that the band may be on the verge of a renaissance, if the missing final recordings, named A Season in Hell, can be located.  She forces her presence into the lives of the remaining band members, who are, by the way, dull as dirt, to piece together the band's history.  The reporter is so creepy and annoying that she'd probably have a restraining order slapped on her, nowadays.  Ironically enough, A Season in Hell describes quite acccurately the viewing experience

The personality of a Nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance.  Fred Leuchter was painted as such by many people, some who knew him(and I'm guessing knew better) and as we may be witnessing others who didn't.  Brownshirts insult, assault, rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas.

Expecting sexy camp in the tradition of "Beyond Valley of the Dolls" I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Instead I struggled through this tedious, repetitive, and confusing mess of a film. I respect what the director was trying to create, but the end product is nearly unwatchable. It's starts out so well too.... "I tried not to remember why I buried my trumpet." ...but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story that isn't the least bit sexy or interesting. I know this film has a sizeable cult following. It is pretty to look at (sometimes when it isn't in grainy slow-motion) but I just couldn't make it through. Maybe it's worth a look, but I personally wish I had rented it

As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found "Altered States", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of "hack movie making". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity

Friday the 13th, Part V - A New Beginning
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Friday the 13th, Part V - A New Beginning is the worst in the series so far and that is saying allot. The acting is much worst then in prior movies. The script is awfull like on a police academy parts 4 and onwards level and that is nothing short of terrible. The special effects looked cheap even for the time the movie was made and the budget is like nothing close to the first couple of movie. The music is outrageously bad and is probably some of the worst 80's music I have ever heard. I love the 80's hairdoes, the tacky cheap looking clothes, and the make up is atrocious.The dialogue is so bad that one wonders if it is a highschool project gone awry. The killing scenes are also kind of lame and they seem to have run out of ideas. The movie is only 92 minutes long but it sure feels it is like at least twice as long and the plot makes no sense at all. This is a movie that has no redeeming qualities and should be avoided at all costs

Maybe it was just me, but this concert DVD is a MAJOR disappointment!  It's quite surprising to see how little (if any) connection Madonna makes with the audience.  Shorn of her locks, her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here. Perhaps it's a result of her having become larger than life (ala Striesand, Whitney Houston,etc.).  Despite all the razzle-dazzle here, examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound.  Songs like "Vogue" and "Express Yourself" should have been rousing stompers.  Instead, they are overstylized, choreographed to the max and perfunctory (the effect is like watching a canned TV award show performance).  Worst of ALL is her ill-conceived "Like A Virgin."  I can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom, but "Virgin" recast as 1940's Marlene Dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch(complete with unisex tuxedo, top hat and faux-German accent)???? This is a shocking lapse in judgment--and boring to boot!!!

Most of it is uninportant dailog that seems to have little or no piont with no story or structure.  There is  alittle action at the end, but of poor qualaty.  To make a long review  short, it is basically like a bad episode of G.I Jeo

Years after its release I find myself writting what I consider a completely biast review for this film (being somewhat of a Star Wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before). Let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film. For me, I grew up watching the original Star Wars (now titled Episode IV, A New Hope). When the original Star Wars came out, it changed the way people looked at Sci-Fi. I saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets, props, costumes, etc. It was the best eye-candy of its time by far. Substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of "holes" in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters. Almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different. Star Wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world, amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial, even the lowest budget Sci-Fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at. Effects do not make a movie and "Attack of the Clones" is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter. Awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither. In retrospect, I wish that George Lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than C3PO and R2D2 (the latter even flies! Imagine that, more capabilities than in the future). This premise is even absurd for the world of Star Wars. According to the story, Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old. As I'm typing this review I can imagine myself typing it with a Royal ribbon typewriter, that just wouldn't happen. It is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that Lucas created but the movie is full of them. He doesn't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy (I,II,III) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier, or why everything looks dated thirty years from now. In his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around. I, however have a solution for all these. George Lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists. Everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past. Then, you could buy all versions of the original trilogy (IV,V,VI). As originally shot, the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters, and the "Ultimate Enhanced Version" to better match the second trilogy (I,II,III). Maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing. Then, you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling (ie., compelling characters, continuity, interesting plotlines, etc). The only reason I give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ILM still makes the film worth watching at least once. Otherwise, I rather watch "Serenity" which has a more Star Wars feel to it than this Star Wars film. The nickname of "Mannequin" to "Annakin" is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story

Poorly Written Script Sends This One Into The Tank.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Private investigator and former police detective Jack Ramsey (Michael Harris) is enjoying an affair with the local district attorney's wife, but when she is strangled not long after he has departed following a session of amorous activity, Ramsey is pegged as the primary suspect due to "clues" obviously planted at the murder scene in order to incriminate him, and additionally because of a zealous detective (Matt McCoy) who has personal persons for disliking the former policeman.  As Ramsey tries to clear his name, the sister (Carrie-Anne Moss) of the deceased shows up, and soon she and Jack begin their own affair that is complicated by subsequent homicides and by Jack's former police partner, performed by Brion James, ostensibly, despite private devils, the sole individual Ramsey can trust as additional evidence mounts against him despite entry of other suspects.  Harris, a charismatic player who has created excellent roles, can do but little with a script that defeats as well the rest of the cast, hindered by a wandering plot that is clich and predictable from the film's opening while, despite helpful cutting, there remains an obligatory slow motion love scene, as well as embarrassing emoting from McCoy, Moss and James that is made unduly prominent because of faltering direction.

That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating!

memorable orientalia wasted on poor film stock!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Being an Oriental I am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours, although not as extensive as standard Hollywood productions. With Japanese films, whether it was made by a Kurusawa or a  more obscure artisan, I can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in  pace, inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals, and are  generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively  substandard.  Village of Dreams, while touted as an award winner  is a  glaring testimony of this stunted Japanese film-making characteristic.  Review it yourself. The pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing. It was  the same character that can be seen even in Kurusawa's Ran - a &quot;highly  acclaimed&quot; work that in my case, I couldn't even view for the third  time, because even its DVD resolution has a quality that can only be  likened to the eye-view of a person who's suffering his earliest stage of  creeping glaucoma.  Village of Dreams is so &quot;relaxed&quot; as if the  filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they  enjoyed in 1940s Japan in an obscure countryside. At the very least, the  straight narrative of this film is a consolation, but with RAN, the actions  were so hard to follow, you'd be puzzled who was fighting and attacking  whom.  The most unforgivable quality of this DVD transfer  is the poor film  stock. The picture approximates that of a &quot;third generation&quot;  recording of a VHS copy. This means that you'll be sorely dissapointed of  having to get a VHS-quality copy COPIED, in turn, from another VHS copy  which was copied from the original VHS &quot;master tape&quot;.  Of course,  the DVD transfer is not at fault, its simply that the Japanese despite  their touted techno prowess just couldn't give us a decent film stock, that  could at least preserve their comparatively well-made gems. The glaring  deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious, when shown on high  resolution TVs. I've viewed this film in a 29-inch Sony Wega Flat TV, and  in a 50-inch Mitsubishi projection TV, from a Pioneer DVL 919 and 909. If  not for the antics of the two children leads, Village comes off as  wearisome. I bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because  I'm a film collector. Its works like this that whets my appreciation for  world cinema. Unfortunately, Village's poor resolution takes away  gratifying cinematic enjoyment, as well  as negating its  &quot;collectability&quot; factor. This should have looked more glorious if  it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like  What Dreams  May Come or Dark City, but of course that's asking too much from those  editing-challenged Japanese filmakers.  I want to ask Amazon for a refund  because this is not well worth its price value. I was compulsed to buy it  because of its cover, I thought it was at least as exotically  glorious-looking as KUNDUN, but it proved to be just a small, obscure  production. Critics may raved about it, just like those Canadians did with  BLACK ROBE, but the final word is that they're just run of the mill, albeit  thoughtful, films....

Of course,as some have opined here, what is perceived as horrifying then and what's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas."Horror-and-brutality technology" in films has definitely-and I use this word wryly-evolved

Exploitation Versus Art--Ingmar Bergman's Oscar Winner and Wes Craven's Shocker Tell The Same Tale
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, "Last House on the Left" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation.

I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending.

People actually gave this movie 5 stars! Are they for real? If you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you. It is fun to watch, but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking. It is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are. Their are so many Scar Face ripoffs it's offencive, and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said "Okay, we don't have much film left, we gotta' rap this up real quick. DMX, find religion...and cut." Rent the movie, try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying, ignore the horrible acting of Naz, then return it. And when you review it please don't give it five stars, those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop, not just some "Phat movie you and some down ass playas' watched while moms was outta' da' house.

I'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot. It's redundant and unnecessary, and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent. Only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself. Double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that's based on and well...

Rule number one if you're making a Stephen King movie, especially if it's a TV movie; make it scary or don't make it at all!  THE TOMMYKNOCKERS fails to do this miserably!  For most of the film, you're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions.  Granted, that's all in the book, but it written chillingly by King in a way only he can do it.  There are some exciting alien moments at the end, but by then it's too late.  You've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an X-FILES episode.

As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found "Altered States", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of "hack movie making". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity

I just read Doug's review of "First Man into Space" and I just had to write respond.  I was seven years old when I saw this movie. As I recall (though my recollection here may be faulty), it was double-billed with "Tom Thumb."  One of my good friends had a birthday party and we all went to the movies.  "First Man into Space" scared the bejeezus out of us. We were so scared we couldn't stop crying. They had to take us out of the movie in the middle--sometime after the car was pulled over by the state trooper.  I thus never saw its conclusion. A few years ago I found the video of the movie and I triumphantly brought it home to show to my teenagers. Needless to say, they made fun of me throughout the movie: "Dad, you were scared by this?!" :-

"Shameless" insufficient use of Jeremy Brett
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I don't usually make a point to watch films this bad (predictable plot, laughable dialog, horrible music soundtrack, etc), but when I saw that my all-time favorite actor Jeremy Brett had a brief but memorable role in "Shameless" (originally titled "Mad Dogs and Englishmen"), I couldn't resist. It's a bizarre experience to witness an actor -- who so perfectly embodied the iconic Sherlock Holmes in the beloved Granada TV series -- appear in such an odd role of a drug-supplying sugar daddy. It's even odder to see a glimpse of him in a modern-day sexual scene with a young woman. Regardless, as usual, he stole the movie even if he was only barely in it. I only wished the director has used Brett to his fullest talents instead of as an aside eccentric.

I wanted to see a romantic and touching movie.  This movie is contrived. The character that Reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie.  Personally, I don't find his behavior to be romantic.  He seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him.  This is not romantic to most women nowadays.  He is not suave in the role he is playing.  It seems like a cheesy 70's contrived romance that does a bad job of it

Dreadful PC Propaganda
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I'm a huge Don Cheadle fan, but this film is unworthy of him. [People] who claim that it's a story about racism either don't understand the film or don't understand racism. Basically, here's the plot: The character played by Mekhi Pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store. Rather than summon help for the others, all Pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register. He is caught, and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life. That is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film, because Pfeiffer's family insists on proving that he's no animal and can take his punishment -- in this case, death -- with his head held high. Yeah, right. Guess what? He is an animal, and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters, racism wouldn't be an issue. A more compelling question: if Pfeiffer's family was so concerned with his "dignity," why didn't they teach him moral values in the first place

Career Death: Dull Action and Dreadful Mess
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Steven Seagal keeps making films. In 2005 alone, he made as many as four films, which itself sounds an amazing feat. Not so amazing, however, if you see `Today You Die' dreadful film with a dreadful title. The press material I managed to get at Japanese theater in Osaka (yes, they dared to release it theatrically in Japan) tells you that the film was shot in only 18 days. Small wonder that none of the film makes sense, gives less actions than awful dialogues.

For what they are worth , my thoughts. Flashes of the Seagal of old, and a step up from Submerged.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Much like Into The Sun, this had all the ingredients for a Seagal come back but yet again the producers of yet another Seagal movie miss the opportunity to deliver a great Seagal action thriller. The movie is again handicapped in the same manner as Into The Sun and Submerged by the recurring problem of what appears to be Seagals disregard of the script or perhaps due to the lack of a script where he seems to make up his own dialogue to fill out a scene. It's as if the camera is turned on and Seagal makes it up as he goes along, conversations involving Seagal and other characters make no sense or have any relevance to the story at hand. In Seagals recent movies there always appears to be a scene which is simply there to give Seagal an ego boast. "Walks like a Black man, breaths like a killer", what was that all about??  The main armored car chase scene is lifted directly from another film made 10 years ago and also the open scenes of The Order with Van Damme is used as the opening scenes in this. I also think though I might be wrong but all the aerial shots of the prison and the prison structure itself looked the same as those used in the Wesley Snipes movie Undisputed. Seagals body double is ever present as usual, Seagals line delivery at times is terrible, yet another muddled and confusing plot and character relevance to the story, Seagal love scene!, fake back drop special effects and bad acting from allot of the supporting cast members are all here present and correct as has become the norm with Seagal movies of late. However it's not all bad, this is a big step up from Submerged, there is no voice dubbing, there are flashes of the old Seagal when he sticks to the script and does his own fight scenes which the two while he is in prison appear to be all Seagal and he is looking in better shape than his last few outings. For me, it was worth the rental as it's not all bad but it did feel very flat and uninteresting while watching it. In Seagals post Exit Wounds years, for me Belly Of The Beast is the mark to aim for and his best since Exit Wounds,  with Half Past Dead, Out Of Reach and The Foreigner(&lt;-- I know people may want to decapitate me for saying that but I like The Foreigner!) following behind. The worst for my viewing pleasure has to be Out For A Kill, Ticker and Submerged(although enjoyable in a it's so bad it's good, kind of way). I'd put Today You Die and Into The Sun in the same box as missed opportunities for two excellent Seagal movies

Albert Pyun is my absolute least favorite director. I hate his guts. His direction ruined &quot;Cyborg&quot; and was murky in &quot;Omega Doom.&quot; This is his best flick, and it's not that good. In fact, it pales in comparison to the so-so original. Sasha Mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable, but highly forgettable. The villain from the first, Tong Po, has returned after killing the Sloan brothers from the first movie. Now, he's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother David Sloan. Standard martial arts fare. Some choppy fight scenes, but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck

Cheeze-Corn...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...

I bought this as a gift for my nephew because I loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie.  I'm very glad I screened it first.  The female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow, boring, and illogical.  I'm not very PC with old movies, but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits.  Choose one of the other Disney re-releases instead.  There are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog

It wasnt all that bad. It had its moments. Brad Renfro (Bully), Dominique Swain (Face/Off), Keram Malicki-Sanchez (tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Emily Bergl (The Rage: Carrie 2), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), James King (Bulletproof Monk) and Jordan Bridges (Mona Lisa Smile, son of Jeff Bridges) star as camp counslers who have, well a lot of problems. Peter Stormare (Eight Millimeter) is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp. Emotions, relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way. James King (former model) looks good dipping in that lake..hmm. Renfro and Swain are so wrong for each other, they should be a couple in real life. Bergl is hot to the bone. Bridges is a bastard. Long is a hoot as a nerdy/geek type of characer and Sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others. Stomare is just weird, plain weird and the kids are brats. So if you liked Heathers, because Daniel Waters wrote it, then this is the movie for yo

Some people praise `We Don't Live Here Any More" as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples, tired of lies, not really knowing what to do. It is also true that Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting. The film as a result looks like a filmed version of some John Updike novels (actually it is based on two shorts by Andre Dubus, whose `Killings' became `In the Bedroom').

Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake).

I have loved Riverdance since the first time I saw it on PBS.  I could wait till I received my Riverdance: Live from New York DVD so many years ago.  Recently, I had a chance to see it on tour when it came to Los Angeles.  I had been waiting for that moment so long and it was everything I could hope for (with the exception of them having removed the song "Home in the Heartland" which any ture fan knows brought the story full circle).  That night, I ordered not only Riverdance: Live from Geneva, but also Jean Butler's Irish Dance DVD (Which I would recommend).  To make a long story short, don't waste your time with this version of the show.  The main female singer is absolutely horrible (Definitely doesn't hold a candle to Katie MacMahon's original vocals), and the lead female dancer's too short hair drove me crazy.  Do yourself a favor and purchase the 1999 DVD Live from New York.  I promise you won't be disappointed

This movie is so bad, it barely deserves mention. However, I am a big DL fan, and I am writing this in the hope that Dolph will not abandon his fans---he may be making movies like this just for the $$, but, I believe, he is also doing irreparable damage to his career

Lack of balance leads to lack of credibility.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act. At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination of the situation on the ground, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create.

Everything is this movie seems out of place. The old cliche &quot;good cop-bad cop&quot;, lived by Sutherland and his pal doesn't work at all!  Dridget is in an awkward performance, totally unconvincing, unreal, flat.  ANyway, it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a  tremendous waste of time.

After a promising start, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's 1944 effort plunges into a sea of MGM mediocrity with a ludicrous plot involving the attempted murder of a boy king. However, Chef Ollie's "Steak a la Oliver" is worth a few laughs

I could not help but to watch this film with all of my African American female sensibilities. Despite the proficient acting, cinematography and directing, I found the content highly offensive and trite. Mr. Kinksy claimed to love Shanduri and was willing to do anything to possess her affections. He was put off to find out that Shanduri was married, but not deterred. Shanduri gave him what she believed was an unattainable challenge to have her husband, who was arrested for speaking out against the government, freed from an African prison. I recognize that it is possible for a servant to fall in love with her employer, however I know that it is extremely rare. (Ask any black woman who's cleaned a white person's house, `how much love do you have for your boss.' The relationship between Shanduri and Mr. Kinksy was one of abuse of power and emotional manipulation. During the `relationship' that I watched develop, not once did Shanduri refer to her employer by his first name. Clearly indicating an uneven balance of power and control...not much different from a slave owner offering to free his children born to his African concubine. So, Mr. Kinksy gave up some of his prized possessions; it was European influence that created the climate that allowed Shanduri's husband to be detained indefinitely. Though I am one among several with a different review about the film, I have no reason to forget the long history of abuse past and present that women of color experienced at the hands of white people, especially white men. To see such a film is an insult and another example of how Europeans do not understand the masses of African Americans

The "Urban Legend" franchise has been pretty steady for the past couple of years. I just don't understand why this movie was made. It shifts from the slasher feel of the previous two movies and delves into a more supernatural focus. The film is pretty bad. I'm definitely a huge fan of horror movies and it doesn't take a lot to impress me but this was just mediocre.

I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie.  My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it.  My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting.  It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well.  The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward.  Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there.  Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast.  We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California).  I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself "why?  Why am I wasting my time like this?

I bought this movie because I thought it would be like the movie version of Louis L'Amour's "Conagher". Unfortunately, it is a far cry from that movie. The Quick and the Dead was too predictable, the dialog was stilted and unrealistic, and the characters...well, they were too much "in character" and not believable. I am curious how faithful the script was to the book. If the movie is as faithful to the book as "Conagher" was, then I apologize to the movie makers and will hold a grudge with Mr. L'Amour instead

i didn't even see this movie and I know it sucks.  All that I had to see was Bon Jovi and I threw the video to the ground as hard as i could muster at the video store where i was promptly kicked out.  It was worth it though, it actually was offensive that such a thing could exist.  The vampire genre could be so awesome and yet very few films live up to its potential.  I guess it also lends itself to complete drivle such as "Vampires - Los Muertos"

The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle.

To begin, I am not a big fan of Cary Grant, EXCEPT in his Hitchcock movies, where he was excellent. And I enjoy him much with Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. He was very good in The Eagle and the Hawk with Fredric March. He was tolerable in The Philadelphia Story and Talk of the Town. A friend of mine loaned me this DVD; she just bought it. I had wanted to see what Cary would do in this film, and I wanted to see him in the dress. From the start, the movie was SLOW and BORING, all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny. I also don't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other, and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other. Come on! I just can't understand that sort of romance situation. I felt Cary showed that "mean streak" he can show in some of his films, in the romance situation of this story. I rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end. All the while I kept saying, "Let's move along, let's end this thing, when does he put on the dress?..." but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring,corny jokes. And the part we wanted to see, Cary in the dress, was at the VERY end and not very much at that. Overall, this film was a real disappointment and letdown. The only consolation was that I saw it for free; I didn't have to buy it or rent it. Still, I wasted good time that I could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way. I would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie!  To sum it up, a VERY VERY BORING and DUMB movie, not to waste your time on.

When Pokemon first debuted, I thought it would rock, and Misty, Brock, and Ash would stay together as a gang forever, and Ash would love it to just be walking around the world, earning badges, etc., and that's the way it would stay. Maybe even Ash and MIsty would fall in love! But, nope. The dudes who are creating these movies are sucking kids in with exclusive Pokemon cards, and the animation is just getting cheaper. This movie is totally different from the original movies and the TV series, and it sucks. I'll hold on to the older series and DVD's, but, nowadays, Brock and Misty are gone, and it's just boring without them. For those who agree with me, get the message out there that Pokemon is going down the tubes and it stinks. Bring back Brock and Misty!!! IT WILL SAVE THE SERIES! Oh, and I'm only giving this movie two stars because they went so far as to make a movie about something so ridiculous, with so much change, and so little things the same. :-( Boo

No, it's certainly not as good as the first one, but I did enjoy some of DEMONS 2. The beginning is cool enough, with the demon's resurrection and it's gaining access into Sally's apartment via the TV set. The tension and dread seem to build quite nicely. That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too. Maybe I just expected D2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing...

I don't write many reviews, but this movie was just so pitifully lame that I felt it was my public duty to warn you about it. The fact that Amazon tries to bundle it with "House of 1,000 Corpses" must be some kind of joke! The dialogue and acting don't even rise to the standards of a made-for-TV movie. The cops don't look, talk, or act like cops, and the lead detective/protagonist works damn hard not to express any kind of personality (his only emotions appear to be boredom and irritation).

I just had my two and a half year old son evaluated as having SI.  The therapist recommended this book.  I found other reviews interesting and was immediately put off by the cover I am looking for whatever positive help I can get.  I wish more was known about this condition.  Or that I knew of a support group as I don't have any family who live anywhere close around me.  My son has an amazing memory and is very lively and outgoing.  He also has extreme tantrums and throws things and seemed to get really fustrated so some of the SI checklist definetly applyed and made sense.  He also is very keyed into me and I can't even get in the shower or go to the bathroom without him getting upset.  Some of what they state didn't seem to fit him though like he crawled and walked early and seemed to have good co-ordination eating with a spoon or fork?

Cheeze-Corn...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...

Rule number one if you're making a Stephen King movie, especially if it's a TV movie; make it scary or don't make it at all!  THE TOMMYKNOCKERS fails to do this miserably!  For most of the film, you're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions.  Granted, that's all in the book, but it written chillingly by King in a way only he can do it.  There are some exciting alien moments at the end, but by then it's too late.  You've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an X-FILES episode.

"Red Water," a made for television film starring Lou Diamond Phillips and Kristy Swanson, carries on the now long and wearisome tradition of ripping off "Jaws." You would think that nearly thirty years after Steven Spielberg's project arrived in theaters filmmakers and producers might move on to another genre. You would be wrong. Every year brings us even more "animal gone wild" flicks, everything from sharks, octopi, whales, snakes, bears, rats, ants, birds, cats, dogs, dinosaurs, crocodiles, alligators, and genetic laboratory experiments gone horribly awry ripping their way through a fresh crop of hapless humans. If the creature in question has sharp teeth, claws, wings, talons, tentacles, and pincers expect to see the monster in question appear in a low budget, straight to video knockoff of "Jaws." Sure, there are elaborations to the standard plot lines, none of which significantly improves these rip-offs, but all of them owe a big debt to Steven Spielberg's film. For example, "Red Water" tries something a little different by having a freshwater shark terrorize people on a Louisiana River. It also inserts a plot thread about a gang of criminals recovering a stash of money from the riverbed. None of these ideas disguises what is really going on.

What shark??
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I watched this movie, seeing that it was a "shark" movie. But where's the shark?? The plot is these people are hostages. The shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie. But I was watching going, "okay, they're in the water, where is the shark???" Even JAWS 3, (which sucked) has more sharks. If you like hoatage movies, see this. (on second thought, don't...) But if you like sharks, see something else

A lot of green light and not much else.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Rule number one if you're making a Stephen King movie, especially if it's a TV movie; make it scary or don't make it at all!  THE TOMMYKNOCKERS fails to do this miserably!  For most of the film, you're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions.  Granted, that's all in the book, but it written chillingly by King in a way only he can do it.  There are some exciting alien moments at the end, but by then it's too late.  You've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an X-FILES episode.

Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..

For those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a S/M relationship, I would highly suggest the Japanese film, "Moonlight Whispers" over "Maitresse." That film is a gentle coming-of-age film with male sub/fem dom theme, while "Maitresse" is a somewhat confused film about an ex-con who stumbles into a dungeon and a (highly unlikely) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix.

I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show

I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show

In the early going, I thought the choice was between four and five stars.  As the movie progressed, my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four, so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second.  The ending was so disappointing that I had to drop my rating to two stars.

I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up.

<Text>
A director who has no idea how to film dance sequences? An important song transmuted into God knows what? Mis-casting galore? A female star without one iota of chrisma? (If she stopped 3 shows cold they must have been high-school productions!) This is...or should have been...about the struggle to not only get a job on Broadway but to hang-on to that which is starting to fade. The all important role of Shiela seems little more than an after thought. Turned into a silly love story (which doesn't even play!) it is merely sad. Sad...and very, very BAD!!!

Where's the passion?

Recently I read about the revival of "A Chorus Line" on Broadway. I've never seen the Broadway show or any other staging of it, so I thought the movie might give me a sneak peek.  Well, somewhat disappointed here.  I can only assume that the stage version, with its long-running reputation, must be better than this film.  It's not that the film is a total debacle, but it's only mildly pleasant -- and quickly forgettable.  Even songs which I had heard before, like "What I Did For Love", were reduced to barely a mention in the film.  The film seemed to lack any real point.  A bit of a yawner.

Pathetic excuse for comedy 0/5 stars
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This movie was even more ignorant (in a bad way) compared to that other movie THE STUPIDS and I thought that movie was ignorantly bad as well. The name of the movie (dumberer) explains how retarded and unfunny this movie really is. The old dumb and dumber movie with jim carrey and jeff daniels is way better than this sorry excuse for comedy + it was part of a classic comedy which made lots of people laugh. Don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for comedy if you like dumb and dumber go for the unrated never before seen film of the old dumb and dumber instead it's worth every penny for comedy fans

I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved.  I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse.  Jet Li was pretty good, but how the hell do you screw that up.  Tsui Hark seemingly didn't rush through this movie, but it still turns out horribley.  I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse

I have to wonder what world, what physical plane, what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on? Or maybe they are Full Moon employees LOL...First of all, the movie, especially one of the earlier scenes, was identical to the 80's flick "The Unnamable", which is also and HP Lovecraft based flick. The castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit. When he breaks out his cell, well this was just hilarious, it reminded me of the incredible hulk. Yes, Jeffrey Combs is in it. But his acting is cheesy as it can be. Hunt down The Unnamable instead, a much better movie

The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them

To put it succinctly, Brendan Fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis, which is then swiped by Joe Pesci, the homeless dude who, predictably, is really quite wise.  The problem is that his "wise" sayings aren't really too wise; he's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent, but doesn't really know that much. Joe Pesci's character is pretty annoying.  That's probably why he ended up friends with Brendan Fraser's character

This is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies I have ever seen.  Don't let the title or the box fool you.  Every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment.  I was shocked that such a film could come out of France.  If you're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass (verbally and physically) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job, then rent this and snack on a can of worms.

the complaints about this dvd release are all correct. great movie, low qaulity release. yet i'm surprised no one has mentioned the thing that angered me most, the self censorship. the bataan race scene where ustinov swaps the bataan for a bottle of beer. we're ok to witness a pirate being drunk, but a sports commentator saying a teenager is running with a bottle of beer is beyond appropriate?  what are the execs at disney thinking? if they need to put out a disclaimer by leonard maltin befor showing such "questionable" material as they did with many of the vault collection... fine, but stop chopping up the movies. our ten year old children are not buying these movies, many of us were actually alive to see the originals and no we're being ripped off. stop angering a loyal fan base with this ignorance. keep this in mind when you contemplate the inevitable release of a cleaned up widescreen version of this title

This film is a documentary, not a movie.  For those of you who admire European films with honest, casual nudity, this film may not be for you.  European films with honest, casual nudity usually are non-pornographic in content.  This film brings the anatomy down to a degrading level.  If you want to view this film, fine, but be prepared for some tears and nausea.  This film is not for the faint-hearted.

This film is about a female student at Randolph University in Alabama in the early 60's who is a writer for the school newspaper.  She gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement.  It could have been a decent movie, but I found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing.  A much, much better movie on this theme is The Long Walk Home and also The Ghosts of Mississippi

Let's face it. Nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie's viewing audience one way or the other. Those who love J.Lo will declare the greathess of this movie, in a variety of ways.  Those who hate J.Lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is. And those who love quality film won't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists. Guilty pleasure, indeed! One thing you have to admit about J.Lo, she's consistent. She sings bad, acts bad, and is merely eye candy, for thoe who find her appealing. And this movie is full of all of the above, plus awful, cliche ridden, emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with Hollywood writing aspirations, since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes. At least it's had it's short, but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels, cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous, just like the lead starlett. Maniupulative only begins to describe this drek. But that said, it's more than enough time wasted on this movie. I merely felt compelled to warn folks. Don't waste your time. It stinks
